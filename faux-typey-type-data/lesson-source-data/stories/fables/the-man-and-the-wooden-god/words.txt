In
the
old
days
men
used
to
worship
stocks
and
stones
and
idols,
and
prayed
to
them
to
give
them
luck.
It
happened
that
a
Man
had
often
prayed
to
a
wooden
idol
he
had
received
from
his
father,
but
his
luck
never
seemed
to
change.
He
prayed
and
he
prayed,
but
still
he
remained
as
unlucky
as
ever.
One
day
in
the
greatest
rage
he
went
to
the
Wooden
God,
and
with
one
blow
swept
it
down
from
its
pedestal.
The
idol
broke
in
two,
and
what
did
he
see?
An
immense
number
of
coins
flying
all
over
the
place.

A
young
Man
had
been
caught
in
a
daring
act
of
theft
and
had
been
condemned
to
be
executed
for
it.
He
expressed
his
desire
to
see
his
Mother,
and
to
speak
with
her
before
he
was
led
to
execution,
and
of
course
this
was
granted.
When
his
Mother
came
to
him
he
said:
"I
want
to
whisper
to
you,"
and
when
she
brought
her
ear
near
him,
he
nearly
bit
it
off.
All
the
bystanders
were
horrified,
and
asked
him
what
he
could
mean
by
such
brutal
and
inhuman
conduct.
"It
is
to
punish
her,"
he
said.
"When
I
was
young
I
began
with
stealing
little
things,
and
brought
them
home
to
Mother.
Instead
of
rebuking
and
punishing
me,
she
laughed
and
said:
"It
will
not
be
noticed."
It
is
because
of
her
that
I
am
here
to-day."
"He
is
right,
woman,"
said
the
Priest;
"the
Lord
hath
said:
"Train
up
a
child
in
the
way
he
should
go;
and
when
he
is
old
he
will
not
depart
therefrom."

Patty
the
Milkmaid
was
going
to
market
carrying
her
milk
in
a
Pail
on
her
head.
As
she
went
along
she
began
calculating
what
she
would
do
with
the
money
she
would
get
for
the
milk.
"I'll
buy
some
fowls
from
Farmer
Brown,"
said
she,
"and
they
will
lay
eggs
each
morning,
which
I
will
sell
to
the
parson's
wife.
With
the
money
that
I
get
from
the
sale
of
these
eggs
I'll
buy
myself
a
new
dimity
frock
and
a
chip
hat;
and
when
I
go
to
market,
won't
all
the
young
men
come
up
and
speak
to
me!
Polly
Shaw
will
be
that
jealous;
but
I
don't
care.
I
shall
just
look
at
her
and
toss
my
head
like
this.
As
she
spoke
she
tossed
her
head
back,
the
Pail
fell
off
it,
and
all
the
milk
was
spilt.
So
she
had
to
go
home
and
tell
her
mother
what
had
occurred.
"Ah,
my
child,"
said
the
mother,
"Do
not
count
your
chickens
before
they
are
hatched."

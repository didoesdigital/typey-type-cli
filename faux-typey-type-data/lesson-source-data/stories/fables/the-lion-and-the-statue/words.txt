A
Man
and
a
Lion
were
discussing
the
relative
strength
of
men
and
lions
in
general.
The
Man
contended
that
he
and
his
fellows
were
stronger
than
lions
by
reason
of
their
greater
intelligence.
"Come
now
with
me,"
he
cried,
"and
I
will
soon
prove
that
I
am
right."
So
he
took
him
into
the
public
gardens
and
showed
him
a
statue
of
Hercules
overcoming
the
Lion
and
tearing
his
mouth
in
two.
"That
is
all
very
well,"
said
the
Lion,
"but
proves
nothing,
for
it
was
a
man
who
made
the
statue."
We
can
easily
represent
things
as
we
wish
them
to
be.

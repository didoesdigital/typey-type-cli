A
Lion
once
fell
in
love
with
a
beautiful
maiden
and
proposed
marriage
to
her
parents.
The
old
people
did
not
know
what
to
say.
They
did
not
like
to
give
their
daughter
to
the
Lion,
yet
they
did
not
wish
to
enrage
the
King
of
Beasts.
At
last
the
father
said:
"We
feel
highly
honoured
by
your
Majesty's
proposal,
but
you
see
our
daughter
is
a
tender
young
thing,
and
we
fear
that
in
the
vehemence
of
your
affection
you
might
possibly
do
her
some
injury.
Might
I
venture
to
suggest
that
your
Majesty
should
have
your
claws
removed,
and
your
teeth
extracted,
then
we
would
gladly
consider
your
proposal
again."
The
Lion
was
so
much
in
love
that
he
had
his
claws
trimmed
and
his
big
teeth
taken
out.
But
when
he
came
again
to
the
parents
of
the
young
girl
they
simply
laughed
in
his
face,
and
bade
him
do
his
worst.
Love
can
tame
the
wildest.

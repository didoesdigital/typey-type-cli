A
Man
had
lost
his
way
in
a
wood
one
bitter
winter's
night.
As
he
was
roaming
about,
a
Satyr
came
up
to
him,
and
finding
that
he
had
lost
his
way,
promised
to
give
him
a
lodging
for
the
night,
and
guide
him
out
of
the
forest
in
the
morning.
As
he
went
along
to
the
Satyr's
cell,
the
Man
raised
both
his
hands
to
his
mouth
and
kept
on
blowing
at
them.
"What
do
you
do
that
for?"
said
the
Satyr.
"My
hands
are
numb
with
the
cold,"
said
the
Man,
"and
my
breath
warms
them."
After
this
they
arrived
at
the
Satyr's
home,
and
soon
the
Satyr
put
a
smoking
dish
of
porridge
before
him.
But
when
the
Man
raised
his
spoon
to
his
mouth
he
began
blowing
upon
it.
"And
what
do
you
do
that
for?"
said
the
Satyr.
"The
porridge
is
too
hot,
and
my
breath
will
cool
it."
"Out
you
go,"
said
the
Satyr.
"I
will
have
nought
to
do
with
a
man
who
can
blow
hot
and
cold
with
the
same
breath."

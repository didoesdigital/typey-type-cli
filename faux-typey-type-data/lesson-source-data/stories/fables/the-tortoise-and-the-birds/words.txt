A
Tortoise
desired
to
change
its
place
of
residence,
so
he
asked
an
Eagle
to
carry
him
to
his
new
home,
promising
her
a
rich
reward
for
her
trouble.
The
Eagle
agreed
and
seizing
the
Tortoise
by
the
shell
with
her
talons
soared
aloft.
on
their
way
they
met
a
Crow,
who
said
to
the
Eagle:
"Tortoise
is
good
eating."
"The
shell
is
too
hard,"
said
the
Eagle
in
reply.
"The
rocks
will
soon
crack
the
shell,"
was
the
Crow's
answer;
and
the
Eagle,
taking
the
hint,
let
fall
the
Tortoise
on
a
sharp
rock,
and
the
two
birds
made
a
hearty
meal
of
the
Tortoise.
Never
soar
aloft
on
an
enemy's
pinions.

"Be
quiet
now,"
said
an
old
Nurse
to
a
child
sitting
on
her
lap.
"If
you
make
that
noise
again
I
will
throw
you
to
the
Wolf."
Now
it
chanced
that
a
Wolf
was
passing
close
under
the
window
as
this
was
said.
So
he
crouched
down
by
the
side
of
the
house
and
waited.
"I
am
in
good
luck
to-day,"
thought
he.
"It
is
sure
to
cry
soon,
and
a
daintier
morsel
I
haven't
had
for
many
a
long
day."
So
he
waited,
and
he
waited,
and
he
waited,
till
at
last
the
child
began
to
cry,
and
the
Wolf
came
forward
before
the
window,
and
looked
up
to
the
Nurse,
wagging
his
tail.
But
all
the
Nurse
did
was
to
shut
down
the
window
and
call
for
help,
and
the
dogs
of
the
house
came
rushing
out.
"Ah,"
said
the
Wolf
as
he
galloped
away,
"Enemies
promises
were
made
to
be
broken."

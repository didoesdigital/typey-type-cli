The
Wind
and
the
Sun
were
disputing
which
was
the
stronger.
Suddenly
they
saw
a
traveller
coming
down
the
road,
and
the
Sun
said:
"I
see
a
way
to
decide
our
dispute.
Whichever
of
us
can
cause
that
traveller
to
take
off
his
cloak
shall
be
regarded
as
the
stronger.
You
begin."
So
the
Sun
retired
behind
a
cloud,
and
the
Wind
began
to
blow
as
hard
as
it
could
upon
the
traveller.
But
the
harder
he
blew
the
more
closely
did
the
traveller
wrap
his
cloak
round
him,
till
at
last
the
Wind
had
to
give
up
in
despair.
Then
the
Sun
came
out
and
shone
in
all
his
glory
upon
the
traveller,
who
soon
found
it
too
hot
to
walk
with
his
cloak
on.
Kindness
effects
more
than
severity.

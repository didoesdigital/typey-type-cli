Once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
Miser
who
used
to
hide
his
gold
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
in
his
garden;
but
every
week
he
used
to
go
and
dig
it
up
and
gloat
over
his
gains.
A
robber,
who
had
noticed
this,
went
and
dug
up
the
gold
and
decamped
with
it.
When
the
Miser
next
came
to
gloat
over
his
treasures,
he
found
nothing
but
the
empty
hole.
He
tore
his
hair,
and
raised
such
an
outcry
that
all
the
neighbours
came
around
him,
and
he
told
them
how
he
used
to
come
and
visit
his
gold.
"Did
you
ever
take
any
of
it
out?"
asked
one
of
them.
"Nay,"
said
he,
"I
only
came
to
look
at
it."
"Then
come
again
and
look
at
the
hole,"
said
a
neighbour;
"it
will
do
you
just
as
much
good."
Wealth
unused
might
as
well
not
exist.

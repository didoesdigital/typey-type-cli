A
Man
and
his
son
were
once
going
with
their
Donkey
to
market.
As
they
were
walking
along
by
its
side
a
countryman
passed
them
and
said:
"You
fools,
what
is
a
Donkey
for
but
to
ride
upon?"
So
the
Man
put
the
Boy
on
the
Donkey
and
they
went
on
their
way.
But
soon
they
passed
a
group
of
men,
one
of
whom
said:
"See
that
lazy
youngster,
he
lets
his
father
walk
while
he
rides."
So
the
Man
ordered
his
Boy
to
get
off,
and
got
on
himself.
But
they
hadn't
gone
far
when
they
passed
two
women,
one
of
whom
said
to
the
other:
"Shame
on
that
lazy
lout
to
let
his
poor
little
son
trudge
along."
Well,
the
Man
didn't
know
what
to
do,
but
at
last
he
took
his
Boy
up
before
him
on
the
Donkey.
By
this
time
they
had
come
to
the
town,
and
the
passers-by
began
to
jeer
and
point
at
them.
The
Man
stopped
and
asked
what
they
were
scoffing
at.
The
men
said:
"Aren't
you
ashamed
of
yourself
for
overloading
that
poor
donkey
of
yours
-
and
your
hulking
son?"
The
Man
and
Boy
got
off
and
tried
to
think
what
to
do.
They
thought
and
they
thought,
till
at
last
they
cut
down
a
pole,
tied
the
donkey's
feet
to
it,
and
raised
the
pole
and
the
donkey
to
their
shoulders.
They
went
along
amid
the
laughter
of
all
who
met
them
till
they
came
to
Market
Bridge,
when
the
Donkey,
getting
one
of
his
feet
loose,
kicked
out
and
caused
the
Boy
to
drop
his
end
of
the
pole.
In
the
struggle
the
Donkey
fell
over
the
bridge,
and
his
fore-feet
being
tied
together
he
was
drowned.
"That
will
teach
you,"
said
an
old
man
who
had
followed
them:
"Please
all,
and
you
will
please
none."

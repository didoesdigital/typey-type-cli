An
old
labourer,
bent
double
with
age
and
toil,
was
gathering
sticks
in
a
forest.
At
last
he
grew
so
tired
and
hopeless
that
he
threw
down
the
bundle
of
sticks,
and
cried
out:
"I
cannot
bear
this
life
any
longer.
Ah,
I
wish
Death
would
only
come
and
take
me!"
As
he
spoke,
Death,
a
grisly
skeleton,
appeared
and
said
to
him:
"What
wouldst
thou,
Mortal?
I
heard
thee
call
me."
"Please,
sir,"
replied
the
woodcutter,
"would
you
kindly
help
me
to
lift
this
faggot
of
sticks
on
to
my
shoulder?"
We
would
often
be
sorry
if
our
wishes
were
gratified.

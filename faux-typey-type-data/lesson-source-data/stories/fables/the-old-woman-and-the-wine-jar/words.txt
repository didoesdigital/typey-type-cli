You
must
know
that
sometimes
old
women
like
a
glass
of
wine.
One
of
this
sort
once
found
a
Wine-jar
lying
in
the
road,
and
eagerly
went
up
to
it
hoping
to
find
it
full.
But
when
she
took
it
up
she
found
that
all
the
wine
had
been
drunk
out
of
it.
Still
she
took
a
long
sniff
at
the
mouth
of
the
Jar.
"Ah,"
she
cried,
"What
memories
cling
'round
the
instruments
of
our
pleasure."

Two
Fellows
were
travelling
together
through
a
wood,
when
a
Bear
rushed
out
upon
them.
One
of
the
travellers
happened
to
be
in
front,
and
he
seized
hold
of
the
branch
of
a
tree,
and
hid
himself
among
the
leaves.
The
other,
seeing
no
help
for
it,
threw
himself
flat
down
upon
the
ground,
with
his
face
in
the
dust.
The
Bear,
coming
up
to
him,
put
his
muzzle
close
to
his
ear,
and
sniffed
and
sniffed.
But
at
last
with
a
growl
he
shook
his
head
and
slouched
off,
for
bears
will
not
touch
dead
meat.
Then
the
fellow
in
the
tree
came
down
to
his
comrade,
and,
laughing,
said
"What
was
it
that
Master
Bruin
whispered
to
you?"
"He
told
me,"
said
the
other,
"Never
trust
a
friend
who
deserts
you
at
a
pinch."

The
Lion
once
gave
out
that
he
was
sick
unto
death
and
summoned
the
animals
to
come
and
hear
his
last
Will
and
Testament.
So
the
Goat
came
to
the
Lion's
cave,
and
stopped
there
listening
for
a
long
time.
Then
a
Sheep
went
in,
and
before
she
came
out
a
Calf
came
up
to
receive
the
last
wishes
of
the
Lord
of
the
Beasts.
But
soon
the
Lion
seemed
to
recover,
and
came
to
the
mouth
of
his
cave,
and
saw
the
Fox,
who
had
been
waiting
outside
for
some
time.
"Why
do
you
not
come
to
pay
your
respects
to
me?"
said
the
Lion
to
the
Fox.
"I
beg
your
Majesty's
pardon,"
said
the
Fox,
"but
I
noticed
the
track
of
the
animals
that
have
already
come
to
you;
and
while
I
see
many
hoof-marks
going
in,
I
see
none
coming
out.
Till
the
animals
that
have
entered
your
cave
come
out
again
I
prefer
to
remain
in
the
open
air."
It
is
easier
to
get
into
the
enemy's
toils
than
out
again.

A
Labourer
lay
listening
to
a
Nightingale's
song
throughout
the
summer
night.
So
pleased
was
he
with
it
that
the
next
night
he
set
a
trap
for
it
and
captured
it.
"Now
that
I
have
caught
thee,"
he
cried,
"thou
shalt
always
sing
to
me."
"We
Nightingales
never
sing
in
a
cage."
said
the
bird.
"Then
I'll
eat
thee."
said
the
Labourer.
"I
have
always
heard
say
that
a
nightingale
on
toast
is
dainty
morsel."
"Nay,
kill
me
not,"
said
the
Nightingale;
"but
let
me
free,
and
I'll
tell
thee
three
things
far
better
worth
than
my
poor
body."
The
Labourer
let
him
loose,
and
he
flew
up
to
a
branch
of
a
tree
and
said:
"Never
believe
a
captive's
promise;
that's
one
thing.
Then
again:
Keep
what
you
have.
And
third
piece
of
advice
is:
Sorrow
not
over
what
is
lost
forever."
then
the
song-bird
flew
away.

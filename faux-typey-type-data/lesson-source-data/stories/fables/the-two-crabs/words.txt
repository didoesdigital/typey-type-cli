One
fine
day
two
Crabs
came
out
from
their
home
to
take
a
stroll
on
the
sand.
"Child,"
said
the
mother,
"you
are
walking
very
ungracefully.
You
should
accustom
yourself,
to
walking
straight
forward
without
twisting
from
side
to
side."
"Pray,
mother,"
said
the
young
one,
"do
but
set
the
example
yourself,
and
I
will
follow
you."
Example
is
the
best
precept.

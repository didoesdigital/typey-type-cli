A
Trumpeter
during
a
battle
ventured
too
near
the
enemy
and
was
captured
by
them.
They
were
about
to
proceed
to
put
him
to
death
when
he
begged
them
to
hear
his
plea
for
mercy.
"I
do
not
fight,"
said
he,
"and
indeed
carry
no
weapon;
I
only
blow
this
trumpet,
and
surely
that
cannot
harm
you;
then
why
should
you
kill
me?"
"You
may
not
fight
yourself,"
said
the
others,
"but
you
encourage
and
guide
your
men
to
the
fight."
Words
may
be
deeds.

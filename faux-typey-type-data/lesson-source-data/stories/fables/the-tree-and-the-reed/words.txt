"Well,
little
one,"
said
a
Tree
to
a
Reed
that
was
growing
at
its
foot,
"why
do
you
not
plant
your
feet
deeply
in
the
ground,
and
raise
your
head
boldly
in
the
air
as
I
do?"
"I
am
contented
with
my
lot,"
said
the
Reed.
"I
may
not
be
so
grand,
but
I
think
I
am
safer."
"Safe!"
sneered
the
Tree.
"Who
shall
pluck
me
up
by
the
roots
or
bow
my
head
to
the
ground?"
but
it
soon
had
to
repent
of
its
boasting,
for
a
hurricane
arose
which
tore
it
up
from
its
roots,
and
cast
it
a
useless
log
on
the
ground,
while
the
little
Reed,
bending
to
the
force
of
the
wind,
soon
stood
upright
again
when
the
storm
had
passed
over.
Obscurity
often
brings
safety.

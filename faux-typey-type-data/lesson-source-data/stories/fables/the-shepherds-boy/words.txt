There
was
once
a
young
Shepherd
Boy
who
tended
his
sheep
at
the
foot
of
a
mountain
near
a
dark
forest.
It
was
rather
lonely
for
him
all
day,
so
he
thought
upon
a
plan
by
which
he
could
get
a
little
company
and
some
excitement.
He
rushed
down
towards
the
village
calling
out
"Wolf,
Wolf,"
and
the
villagers
came
out
to
meet
him,
and
some
of
them
stopped
with
him
for
a
considerable
time.
This
pleased
the
boy
so
much
that
a
few
days
afterwards
he
tried
the
same
trick,
and
again
the
villagers
came
to
his
help.
But
shortly
after
this
a
Wolf
actually
did
come
out
from
the
forest,
and
began
to
worry
the
sheep,
and
the
boy
of
course
cried
out
"Wolf,
Wolf,"
still
louder
than
before.
But
this
time
the
villagers,
who
had
been
fooled
twice
before,
thought
the
boy
was
again
deceiving
them,
and
nobody
stirred
to
come
to
his
help.
So
the
Wolf
made
a
good
meal
off
the
boy's
flock,
and
when
the
boy
complained,
the
wise
man
of
the
village
said:
"A
liar
will
not
be
believed,
even
when
he
speaks
the
truth."

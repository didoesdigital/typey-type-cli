Two
Pots
had
been
left
on
the
bank
of
a
river,
one
of
brass,
and
one
of
earthenware.
When
the
tide
rose
they
both
floated
off
down
the
stream.
Now
the
earthenware
pot
tried
its
best
to
keep
aloof
from
the
brass
one,
which
cried
out:
"Fear
nothing,
friend,
I
will
not
strike
you."
"But
I
may
come
in
contact
with
you,"
said
the
other,
"if
I
come
too
close;
and
whether
I
hit
you,
or
you
hit
me,
I
shall
suffer
for
it."
The
strong
and
the
weak
cannot
keep
company.

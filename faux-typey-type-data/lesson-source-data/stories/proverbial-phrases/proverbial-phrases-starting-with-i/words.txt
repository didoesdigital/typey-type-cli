If
anything
can
go
wrong,
it
will.
If
a
job
is
worth
doing,
it
is
worth
doing
well.
If
at
first
you
do
not
succeed,
try,
try
again.
If
God
had
meant
us
to
fly,
he
would
have
given
us
wings.
If
ifs
and
ands
were
pots
and
pans,
there
would
be
no
work
for
tinkers.
If
it
ain't
broke,
don't
fix
it.
If
it
were
not
for
hope
the
heart
would
break.
If
it
were
a
snake,
it
would
have
bit
you.
If
the
shoe
fits,
wear
it.
If
the
mountain
will
not
come
to
Mohammed,
then
Mohammed
must
go
to
the
mountain.
If
wealth
is
lost,
nothing
is
lost.
If
wishes
were
horses,
beggars
would
ride.
If
you're
growing
in
age,
then
you're
nearing
to
the
graveyard.
If
you
cannot
be
good,
be
careful.
If
you
cannot
beat
them,
join
them.
If
you
cannot
live
longer,
live
deeper.
If
you
cannot
stand
the
heat,
get
out
of
the
kitchen.
If
you
give
a
mouse
a
cookie,
he'll
always
ask
for
a
glass
of
milk.
If
you
think
that
you
know
everything,
then
you're
a
Jack
ass.
If
you
lie
down
with
dogs,
you
will
get
up
with
fleas.
If
you
pay
peanuts,
you
get
monkeys.
If
you
play
with
fire,
you
will
get
burned.
If
you
steal
from
one
author,
it
is
plagiarism;
if
you
steal
from
many,
it
is
research.
If
you
want
a
thing
done
well,
do
it
yourself.
If
you
have
never
seen
the
bottom
of
the
tree,
you
cannot
know
how
tall
it
stands.
If
you
must
dance
with
the
Devil,
you
might
as
well
know
his
favorite
song.
If
you've
got
it,
flaunt
it.
Ignorance
is
bliss.
Imitation
is
the
sincerest
form
of
flattery.
In
for
a
penny,
in
for
a
pound.
In
like
a
lion,
out
like
a
lamb.
In
the
kingdom
of
the
blind,
the
one
eyed
man
is
king.
In
the
midst
of
life,
we
are
in
death.
Into
every
life
a
little
rain
must
fall.
It
ain't
over
till
it's
over.
It
ain't
over
till
the
fat
lady
sings.
It
ain't
what
you
don't
know
that
gets
you
into
trouble.
It
goes
without
saying.
It
is
a
small
world.
It
is
all
grist
to
the
mill.
It
is
an
ill
wind
that
blows
no
one
any
good.
It
is
best
to
be
on
the
safe
side.
It
is
better
to
be
smarter
than
you
appear
than
to
appear
smarter
than
you
are.
It
is
better
to
give
than
to
receive.
It
is
better
to
have
loved
and
lost
than
never
to
have
loved
at
all.
It
is
better
to
cultivate
a
Land
with
two
Bulls,
rather
working
under
Boss
who
never
gives
Wage
when
asked.
It
is
better
to
light
a
candle
than
curse
the
darkness.
It
is
better
to
travel
hopefully
than
to
arrive.
It
is
easy
to
be
wise
after
the
event.
It
is
like
juggling
sand.
It
is
never
too
late.
It
is
no
use
crying
over
spilt
milk.
It
is
no
use
locking
the
stable
door
after
the
horse
has
bolted.
It
is
not
enough
to
learn
how
to
ride,
you
must
also
learn
how
to
fall.
It
is
on.
It
is
the
early
bird
that
gets
the
worm.
It
is
the
empty
can
that
makes
the
most
noise.
It
is
the
squeaky
wheel
that
gets
the
grease.
It
is
what
it
is.
It
needs
a
hundred
lies
to
cover
a
single
lie.
It
never
rains
but
it
pours.
It
takes
a
thief
to
catch
a
thief.
It
takes
a
whole
village
to
raise
a
child.
It
takes
all
sorts
to
make
a
world.
It
takes
one
to
know
one.
It
takes
two
to
tango.
I'm
going
to
have
to
give
you
the
pink
slip.
It
will
come
back
and
haunt
you.
It
will
be
the
same
a
hundred
years
hence.
Islands
depend
on
reeds,just
as
reeds
depend
on
islands.

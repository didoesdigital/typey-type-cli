Such
an
expression
of
unhappiness
was
enough
by
itself
to
make
one's
eyes
slide
above
the
paper's
edge
to
the
poor
woman's
face—insignificant
without
that
look,
almost
a
symbol
of
human
destiny
with
it.
Life's
what
you
see
in
people's
eyes;
life's
what
they
learn,
and,
having
learnt
it,
never,
though
they
seek
to
hide
it,
cease
to
be
aware
of—what?
That
life's
like
that,
it
seems.
Five
faces
opposite—five
mature
faces—and
the
knowledge
in
each
face.
Strange,
though,
how
people
want
to
conceal
it!
Marks
of
reticence
are
on
all
those
faces:
lips
shut,
eyes
shaded,
each
one
of
the
five
doing
something
to
hide
or
stultify
his
knowledge.
One
smokes;
another
reads;
a
third
checks
entries
in
a
pocket
book;
a
fourth
stares
at
the
map
of
the
line
framed
opposite;
and
the
fifth—the
terrible
thing
about
the
fifth
is
that
she
does
nothing
at
all.
She
looks
at
life.
Ah,
but
my
poor,
unfortunate
woman,
do
play
the
game—do,
for
all
our
sakes,
conceal
it!
As
if
she
heard
me,
she
looked
up,
shifted
slightly
in
her
seat
and
sighed.
She
seemed
to
apologise
and
at
the
same
time
to
say
to
me,
"If
only
you
knew!"
Then
she
looked
at
life
again.
"But
I
do
know,"
I
answered
silently,
glancing
at
the
Times
for
manners'
sake.
"I
know
the
whole
business.
'Peace
between
Germany
and
the
Allied
Powers
was
yesterday
officially
ushered
in
at
Paris—Signor
Nitti,
the
Italian
Prime
Minister—a
passenger
train
at
Doncaster
was
in
collision
with
a
goods
train....'
We
all
know—the
Times
knows—but
we
pretend
we
don't."
My
eyes
had
once
more
crept
over
the
paper's
rim.
She
shuddered,
twitched
her
arm
queerly
to
the
middle
of
her
back
and
shook
her
head.
Again
I
dipped
into
my
great
reservoir
of
life.
"Take
what
you
like,"
I
continued,
"births,
deaths,
marriages,
Court
Circular,
the
habits
of
birds,
Leonardo
da
Vinci,
the
Sandhills
murder,
high
wages
and
the
cost
of
living—oh,
take
what
you
like,"
I
repeated,
"it's
all
in
the
Times!"
Again
with
infinite
weariness
she
moved
her
head
from
side
to
side
until,
like
a
top
exhausted
with
spinning,
it
settled
on
her
neck.
The
Times
was
no
protection
against
such
sorrow
as
hers.
But
other
human
beings
forbade
intercourse.
The
best
thing
to
do
against
life
was
to
fold
the
paper
so
that
it
made
a
perfect
square,
crisp,
thick,
impervious
even
to
life.
This
done,
I
glanced
up
quickly,
armed
with
a
shield
of
my
own.
She
pierced
through
my
shield;
she
gazed
into
my
eyes
as
if
searching
any
sediment
of
courage
at
the
depths
of
them
and
damping
it
to
clay.
Her
twitch
alone
denied
all
hope,
discounted
all
illusion.
So
we
rattled
through
Surrey
and
across
the
border
into
Sussex.
But
with
my
eyes
upon
life
I
did
not
see
that
the
other
travellers
had
left,
one
by
one,
till,
save
for
the
man
who
read,
we
were
alone
together.
Here
was
Three
Bridges
station.
We
drew
slowly
down
the
platform
and
stopped.
Was
he
going
to
leave
us?
I
prayed
both
ways—I
prayed
last
that
he
might
stay.
At
that
instant
he
roused
himself,
crumpled
his
paper
contemptuously,
like
a
thing
done
with,
burst
open
the
door,
and
left
us
alone.
The
unhappy
woman,
leaning
a
little
forward,
palely
and
colourlessly
addressed
me—talked
of
stations
and
holidays,
of
brothers
at
Eastbourne,
and
the
time
of
year,
which
was,
I
forget
now,
early
or
late.
But
at
last
looking
from
the
window
and
seeing,
I
knew,
only
life,
she
breathed,
"Staying
away—that's
the
drawback
of
it——"
Ah,
now
we
approached
the
catastrophe,
"My
sister-in-law"—the
bitterness
of
her
tone
was
like
lemon
on
cold
steel,
and
speaking,
not
to
me,
but
to
herself,
she
muttered,
"nonsense,
she
would
say—that's
what
they
all
say,"
and
while
she
spoke
she
fidgeted
as
though
the
skin
on
her
back
were
as
a
plucked
fowl's
in
a
poulterer's
shop-window.
"Oh,
that
cow!"
she
broke
off
nervously,
as
though
the
great
wooden
cow
in
the
meadow
had
shocked
her
and
saved
her
from
some
indiscretion.
Then
she
shuddered,
and
then
she
made
the
awkward
angular
movement
that
I
had
seen
before,
as
if,
after
the
spasm,
some
spot
between
the
shoulders
burnt
or
itched.
Then
again
she
looked
the
most
unhappy
woman
in
the
world,
and
I
once
more
reproached
her,
though
not
with
the
same
conviction,
for
if
there
were
a
reason,
and
if
I
knew
the
reason,
the
stigma
was
removed
from
life.
"Sisters-in-law,"
I
said—
Her
lips
pursed
as
if
to
spit
venom
at
the
word;
pursed
they
remained.
All
she
did
was
to
take
her
glove
and
rub
hard
at
a
spot
on
the
window-pane.
She
rubbed
as
if
she
would
rub
something
out
for
ever—some
stain,
some
indelible
contamination.
Indeed,
the
spot
remained
for
all
her
rubbing,
and
back
she
sank
with
the
shudder
and
the
clutch
of
the
arm
I
had
come
to
expect.
Something
impelled
me
to
take
my
glove
and
rub
my
window.
There,
too,
was
a
little
speck
on
the
glass.
For
all
my
rubbing
it
remained.
And
then
the
spasm
went
through
me;
I
crooked
my
arm
and
plucked
at
the
middle
of
my
back.
My
skin,
too,
felt
like
the
damp
chicken's
skin
in
the
poulterer's
shop-window;
one
spot
between
the
shoulders
itched
and
irritated,
felt
clammy,
felt
raw.
Could
I
reach
it?
Surreptitiously
I
tried.
She
saw
me.
A
smile
of
infinite
irony,
infinite
sorrow,
flitted
and
faded
from
her
face.
But
she
had
communicated,
shared
her
secret,
passed
her
poison;
she
would
speak
no
more.
Leaning
back
in
my
corner,
shielding
my
eyes
from
her
eyes,
seeing
only
the
slopes
and
hollows,
greys
and
purples,
of
the
winter's
landscape,
I
read
her
message,
deciphered
her
secret,
reading
it
beneath
her
gaze.
Hilda's
the
sister-in-law.
Hilda?
Hilda?
Hilda
Marsh—Hilda
the
blooming,
the
full
bosomed,
the
matronly.
Hilda
stands
at
the
door
as
the
cab
draws
up,
holding
a
coin.
"Poor
Minnie,
more
of
a
grasshopper
than
ever—old
cloak
she
had
last
year.
Well,
well,
with
two
children
these
days
one
can't
do
more.
No,
Minnie,
I've
got
it;
here
you
are,
cabby—none
of
your
ways
with
me.
Come
in,
Minnie.
Oh,
I
could
carry
you,
let
alone
your
basket!"
So
they
go
into
the
dining-room.
"Aunt
Minnie,
children."
Slowly
the
knives
and
forks
sink
from
the
upright.
Down
they
get
(Bob
and
Barbara),
hold
out
hands
stiffly;
back
again
to
their
chairs,
staring
between
the
resumed
mouthfuls.
[But
this
we'll
skip;
ornaments,
curtains,
trefoil
china
plate,
yellow
oblongs
of
cheese,
white
squares
of
biscuit—skip—oh,
but
wait!
Halfway
through
luncheon
one
of
those
shivers;
Bob
stares
at
her,
spoon
in
mouth.
"Get
on
with
your
pudding,
Bob;"
but
Hilda
disapproves.
"Why
should
she
twitch?"
Skip,
skip,
till
we
reach
the
landing
on
the
upper
floor;
stairs
brass-bound;
linoleum
worn;
oh,
yes!
little
bedroom
looking
out
over
the
roofs
of
Eastbourne—zigzagging
roofs
like
the
spines
of
caterpillars,
this
way,
that
way,
striped
red
and
yellow,
with
blue-black
slating].
Now,
Minnie,
the
door's
shut;
Hilda
heavily
descends
to
the
basement;
you
unstrap
the
straps
of
your
basket,
lay
on
the
bed
a
meagre
nightgown,
stand
side
by
side
furred
felt
slippers.
The
looking-glass—no,
you
avoid
the
looking-glass.
Some
methodical
disposition
of
hat-pins.
Perhaps
the
shell
box
has
something
in
it?
You
shake
it;
it's
the
pearl
stud
there
was
last
year—that's
all.
And
then
the
sniff,
the
sigh,
the
sitting
by
the
window.
Three
o'clock
on
a
December
afternoon;
the
rain
drizzling;
one
light
low
in
the
skylight
of
a
drapery
emporium;
another
high
in
a
servant's
bedroom—this
one
goes
out.
That
gives
her
nothing
to
look
at.
A
moment's
blankness—then,
what
are
you
thinking?
(Let
me
peep
across
at
her
opposite;
she's
asleep
or
pretending
it;
so
what
would
she
think
about
sitting
at
the
window
at
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon?
Health,
money,
hills,
her
God?)
Yes,
sitting
on
the
very
edge
of
the
chair
looking
over
the
roofs
of
Eastbourne,
Minnie
Marsh
prays
to
God.
That's
all
very
well;
and
she
may
rub
the
pane
too,
as
though
to
see
God
better;
but
what
God
does
she
see?
Who's
the
God
of
Minnie
Marsh,
the
God
of
the
back
streets
of
Eastbourne,
the
God
of
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon?
I,
too,
see
roofs,
I
see
sky;
but,
oh,
dear—this
seeing
of
Gods!
More
like
President
Kruger
than
Prince
Albert—that's
the
best
I
can
do
for
him;
and
I
see
him
on
a
chair,
in
a
black
frock-coat,
not
so
very
high
up
either;
I
can
manage
a
cloud
or
two
for
him
to
sit
on;
and
then
his
hand
trailing
in
the
cloud
holds
a
rod,
a
truncheon
is
it?—black,
thick,
thorned—a
brutal
old
bully—Minnie's
God!
Did
he
send
the
itch
and
the
patch
and
the
twitch?
Is
that
why
she
prays?
What
she
rubs
on
the
window
is
the
stain
of
sin.
Oh,
she
committed
some
crime!
I
have
my
choice
of
crimes.
The
woods
flit
and
fly—in
summer
there
are
bluebells;
in
the
opening
there,
when
Spring
comes,
primroses.
A
parting,
was
it,
twenty
years
ago?
Vows
broken?
Not
Minnie's!...
She
was
faithful.
How
she
nursed
her
mother!
All
her
savings
on
the
tombstone—wreaths
under
glass—daffodils
in
jars.
But
I'm
off
the
track.
A
crime....
They
would
say
she
kept
her
sorrow,
suppressed
her
secret—her
sex,
they'd
say—the
scientific
people.
But
what
flummery
to
saddle
her
with
sex!
No—more
like
this.
Passing
down
the
streets
of
Croydon
twenty
years
ago,
the
violet
loops
of
ribbon
in
the
draper's
window
spangled
in
the
electric
light
catch
her
eye.
She
lingers—past
six.
Still
by
running
she
can
reach
home.
She
pushes
through
the
glass
swing
door.
It's
sale-time.
Shallow
trays
brim
with
ribbons.
She
pauses,
pulls
this,
fingers
that
with
the
raised
roses
on
it—no
need
to
choose,
no
need
to
buy,
and
each
tray
with
its
surprises.
"We
don't
shut
till
seven,"
and
then
it
is
seven.
She
runs,
she
rushes,
home
she
reaches,
but
too
late.
Neighbours—the
doctor—baby
brother—the
kettle—scalded—hospital—dead—or
only
the
shock
of
it,
the
blame?
Ah,
but
the
detail
matters
nothing!
It's
what
she
carries
with
her;
the
spot,
the
crime,
the
thing
to
expiate,
always
there
between
her
shoulders.
"Yes,"
she
seems
to
nod
to
me,
"it's
the
thing
I
did."
Whether
you
did,
or
what
you
did,
I
don't
mind;
it's
not
the
thing
I
want.
The
draper's
window
looped
with
violet—that'll
do;
a
little
cheap
perhaps,
a
little
commonplace—since
one
has
a
choice
of
crimes,
but
then
so
many
(let
me
peep
across
again—still
sleeping,
or
pretending
sleep!
white,
worn,
the
mouth
closed—a
touch
of
obstinacy,
more
than
one
would
think—no
hint
of
sex)—so
many
crimes
aren't
your
crime;
your
crime
was
cheap;
only
the
retribution
solemn;
for
now
the
church
door
opens,
the
hard
wooden
pew
receives
her;
on
the
brown
tiles
she
kneels;
every
day,
winter,
summer,
dusk,
dawn
(here
she's
at
it)
prays.
All
her
sins
fall,
fall,
for
ever
fall.
The
spot
receives
them.
It's
raised,
it's
red,
it's
burning.
Next
she
twitches.
Small
boys
point.
"Bob
at
lunch
to-day"—But
elderly
women
are
the
worst.
Indeed
now
you
can't
sit
praying
any
longer.
Kruger's
sunk
beneath
the
clouds—washed
over
as
with
a
painter's
brush
of
liquid
grey,
to
which
he
adds
a
tinge
of
black—even
the
tip
of
the
truncheon
gone
now.
That's
what
always
happens!
Just
as
you've
seen
him,
felt
him,
someone
interrupts.
It's
Hilda
now.
How
you
hate
her!
She'll
even
lock
the
bathroom
door
overnight,
too,
though
it's
only
cold
water
you
want,
and
sometimes
when
the
night's
been
bad
it
seems
as
if
washing
helped.
And
John
at
breakfast—the
children—meals
are
worst,
and
sometimes
there
are
friends—ferns
don't
altogether
hide
'em—they
guess,
too;
so
out
you
go
along
the
front,
where
the
waves
are
grey,
and
the
papers
blow,
and
the
glass
shelters
green
and
draughty,
and
the
chairs
cost
tuppence—too
much—for
there
must
be
preachers
along
the
sands.
Ah,
that's
a
nigger—that's
a
funny
man—that's
a
man
with
parakeets—poor
little
creatures!
Is
there
no
one
here
who
thinks
of
God?—just
up
there,
over
the
pier,
with
his
rod—but
no—there's
nothing
but
grey
in
the
sky
or
if
it's
blue
the
white
clouds
hide
him,
and
the
music—it's
military
music—and
what
they
are
fishing
for?
Do
they
catch
them?
How
the
children
stare!
Well,
then
home
a
back
way—"Home
a
back
way!"
The
words
have
meaning;
might
have
been
spoken
by
the
old
man
with
whiskers—no,
no,
he
didn't
really
speak;
but
everything
has
meaning—placards
leaning
against
doorways—names
above
shop-windows—red
fruit
in
baskets—women's
heads
in
the
hairdresser's—all
say
"Minnie
Marsh!"
But
here's
a
jerk.
"Eggs
are
cheaper!"
That's
what
always
happens!
I
was
heading
her
over
the
waterfall,
straight
for
madness,
when,
like
a
flock
of
dream
sheep,
she
turns
t'other
way
and
runs
between
my
fingers.
Eggs
are
cheaper.
Tethered
to
the
shores
of
the
world,
none
of
the
crimes,
sorrows,
rhapsodies,
or
insanities
for
poor
Minnie
Marsh;
never
late
for
luncheon;
never
caught
in
a
storm
without
a
mackintosh;
never
utterly
unconscious
of
the
cheapness
of
eggs.
So
she
reaches
home—scrapes
her
boots.
Have
I
read
you
right?
But
the
human
face—the
human
face
at
the
top
of
the
fullest
sheet
of
print
holds
more,
withholds
more.
Now,
eyes
open,
she
looks
out;
and
in
the
human
eye—how
d'you
define
it?—there's
a
break—a
division—so
that
when
you've
grasped
the
stem
the
butterfly's
off—the
moth
that
hangs
in
the
evening
over
the
yellow
flower—move,
raise
your
hand,
off,
high,
away.
I
won't
raise
my
hand.
Hang
still,
then,
quiver,
life,
soul,
spirit,
whatever
you
are
of
Minnie
Marsh—I,
too,
on
my
flower—the
hawk
over
the
down—alone,
or
what
were
the
worth
of
life?
To
rise;
hang
still
in
the
evening,
in
the
midday;
hang
still
over
the
down.
The
flicker
of
a
hand—off,
up!
then
poised
again.
Alone,
unseen;
seeing
all
so
still
down
there,
all
so
lovely.
None
seeing,
none
caring.
The
eyes
of
others
our
prisons;
their
thoughts
our
cages.
Air
above,
air
below.
And
the
moon
and
immortality....
Oh,
but
I
drop
to
the
turf!
Are
you
down
too,
you
in
the
corner,
what's
your
name—woman—Minnie
Marsh;
some
such
name
as
that?
There
she
is,
tight
to
her
blossom;
opening
her
hand-bag,
from
which
she
takes
a
hollow
shell—an
egg—who
was
saying
that
eggs
were
cheaper?
You
or
I?
Oh,
it
was
you
who
said
it
on
the
way
home,
you
remember,
when
the
old
gentleman,
suddenly
opening
his
umbrella—or
sneezing
was
it?
Anyhow,
Kruger
went,
and
you
came
"home
a
back
way,"
and
scraped
your
boots.
Yes.
And
now
you
lay
across
your
knees
a
pocket-handkerchief
into
which
drop
little
angular
fragments
of
eggshell—fragments
of
a
map—a
puzzle.
I
wish
I
could
piece
them
together!
If
you
would
only
sit
still.
She's
moved
her
knees—the
map's
in
bits
again.
Down
the
slopes
of
the
Andes
the
white
blocks
of
marble
go
bounding
and
hurtling,
crushing
to
death
a
whole
troop
of
Spanish
muleteers,
with
their
convoy—Drake's
booty,
gold
and
silver.
But
to
return——
To
what,
to
where?
She
opened
the
door,
and,
putting
her
umbrella
in
the
stand—that
goes
without
saying;
so,
too,
the
whiff
of
beef
from
the
basement;
dot,
dot,
dot.
But
what
I
cannot
thus
eliminate,
what
I
must,
head
down,
eyes
shut,
with
the
courage
of
a
battalion
and
the
blindness
of
a
bull,
charge
and
disperse
are,
indubitably,
the
figures
behind
the
ferns,
commercial
travellers.
There
I've
hidden
them
all
this
time
in
the
hope
that
somehow
they'd
disappear,
or
better
still
emerge,
as
indeed
they
must,
if
the
story's
to
go
on
gathering
richness
and
rotundity,
destiny
and
tragedy,
as
stories
should,
rolling
along
with
it
two,
if
not
three,
commercial
travellers
and
a
whole
grove
of
aspidistra.
"The
fronds
of
the
aspidistra
only
partly
concealed
the
commercial
traveller—"
Rhododendrons
would
conceal
him
utterly,
and
into
the
bargain
give
me
my
fling
of
red
and
white,
for
which
I
starve
and
strive;
but
rhododendrons
in
Eastbourne—in
December—on
the
Marshes'
table—no,
no,
I
dare
not;
it's
all
a
matter
of
crusts
and
cruets,
frills
and
ferns.
Perhaps
there'll
be
a
moment
later
by
the
sea.
Moreover,
I
feel,
pleasantly
pricking
through
the
green
fretwork
and
over
the
glacis
of
cut
glass,
a
desire
to
peer
and
peep
at
the
man
opposite—one's
as
much
as
I
can
manage.
James
Moggridge
is
it,
whom
the
Marshes
call
Jimmy?
[Minnie,
you
must
promise
not
to
twitch
till
I've
got
this
straight].
James
Moggridge
travels
in—shall
we
say
buttons?—but
the
time's
not
come
for
bringing
them
in—the
big
and
the
little
on
the
long
cards,
some
peacock-eyed,
others
dull
gold;
cairngorms
some,
and
others
coral
sprays—but
I
say
the
time's
not
come.
He
travels,
and
on
Thursdays,
his
Eastbourne
day,
takes
his
meals
with
the
Marshes.
His
red
face,
his
little
steady
eyes—by
no
means
altogether
commonplace—his
enormous
appetite
(that's
safe;
he
won't
look
at
Minnie
till
the
bread's
swamped
the
gravy
dry),
napkin
tucked
diamond-wise—but
this
is
primitive,
and,
whatever
it
may
do
the
reader,
don't
take
me
in.
Let's
dodge
to
the
Moggridge
household,
set
that
in
motion.
Well,
the
family
boots
are
mended
on
Sundays
by
James
himself.
He
reads
Truth.
But
his
passion?
Roses—and
his
wife
a
retired
hospital
nurse—interesting—for
God's
sake
let
me
have
one
woman
with
a
name
I
like!
But
no;
she's
of
the
unborn
children
of
the
mind,
illicit,
none
the
less
loved,
like
my
rhododendrons.
How
many
die
in
every
novel
that's
written—the
best,
the
dearest,
while
Moggridge
lives.
It's
life's
fault.
Here's
Minnie
eating
her
egg
at
the
moment
opposite
and
at
t'other
end
of
the
line—are
we
past
Lewes?—there
must
be
Jimmy—or
what's
her
twitch
for?
There
must
be
Moggridge—life's
fault.
Life
imposes
her
laws;
life
blocks
the
way;
life's
behind
the
fern;
life's
the
tyrant;
oh,
but
not
the
bully!
No,
for
I
assure
you
I
come
willingly;
I
come
wooed
by
Heaven
knows
what
compulsion
across
ferns
and
cruets,
table
splashed
and
bottles
smeared.
I
come
irresistibly
to
lodge
myself
somewhere
on
the
firm
flesh,
in
the
robust
spine,
wherever
I
can
penetrate
or
find
foothold
on
the
person,
in
the
soul,
of
Moggridge
the
man.
The
enormous
stability
of
the
fabric;
the
spine
tough
as
whalebone,
straight
as
oak-tree;
the
ribs
radiating
branches;
the
flesh
taut
tarpaulin;
the
red
hollows;
the
suck
and
regurgitation
of
the
heart;
while
from
above
meat
falls
in
brown
cubes
and
beer
gushes
to
be
churned
to
blood
again—and
so
we
reach
the
eyes.
Behind
the
aspidistra
they
see
something:
black,
white,
dismal;
now
the
plate
again;
behind
the
aspidistra
they
see
elderly
woman;
"Marsh's
sister,
Hilda's
more
my
sort;"
the
tablecloth
now.
"Marsh
would
know
what's
wrong
with
Morrises
..."
talk
that
over;
cheese
has
come;
the
plate
again;
turn
it
round—the
enormous
fingers;
now
the
woman
opposite.
"Marsh's
sister—not
a
bit
like
Marsh;
wretched,
elderly
female....
You
should
feed
your
hens....
God's
truth,
what's
set
her
twitching?
Not
what
I
said?
Dear,
dear,
dear!
these
elderly
women.
Dear,
dear!"
[Yes,
Minnie;
I
know
you've
twitched,
but
one
moment—James
Moggridge].
"Dear,
dear,
dear!"
How
beautiful
the
sound
is!
like
the
knock
of
a
mallet
on
seasoned
timber,
like
the
throb
of
the
heart
of
an
ancient
whaler
when
the
seas
press
thick
and
the
green
is
clouded.
"Dear,
dear!"
what
a
passing
bell
for
the
souls
of
the
fretful
to
soothe
them
and
solace
them,
lap
them
in
linen,
saying,
"So
long.
Good
luck
to
you!"
and
then,
"What's
your
pleasure?"
for
though
Moggridge
would
pluck
his
rose
for
her,
that's
done,
that's
over.
Now
what's
the
next
thing?
"Madam,
you'll
miss
your
train,"
for
they
don't
linger.
That's
the
man's
way;
that's
the
sound
that
reverberates;
that's
St.
Paul's
and
the
motor-omnibuses.
But
we're
brushing
the
crumbs
off.
Oh,
Moggridge,
you
won't
stay?
You
must
be
off?
Are
you
driving
through
Eastbourne
this
afternoon
in
one
of
those
little
carriages?
Are
you
the
man
who's
walled
up
in
green
cardboard
boxes,
and
sometimes
has
the
blinds
down,
and
sometimes
sits
so
solemn
staring
like
a
sphinx,
and
always
there's
a
look
of
the
sepulchral,
something
of
the
undertaker,
the
coffin,
and
the
dusk
about
horse
and
driver?
Do
tell
me—but
the
doors
slammed.
We
shall
never
meet
again.
Moggridge,
farewell!
Yes,
yes,
I'm
coming.
Right
up
to
the
top
of
the
house.
One
moment
I'll
linger.
How
the
mud
goes
round
in
the
mind—what
a
swirl
these
monsters
leave,
the
waters
rocking,
the
weeds
waving
and
green
here,
black
there,
striking
to
the
sand,
till
by
degrees
the
atoms
reassemble,
the
deposit
sifts
itself,
and
again
through
the
eyes
one
sees
clear
and
still,
and
there
comes
to
the
lips
some
prayer
for
the
departed,
some
obsequy
for
the
souls
of
those
one
nods
to,
the
people
one
never
meets
again.
James
Moggridge
is
dead
now,
gone
for
ever.
Well,
Minnie—"I
can
face
it
no
longer."
If
she
said
that—(Let
me
look
at
her.
She
is
brushing
the
eggshell
into
deep
declivities).
She
said
it
certainly,
leaning
against
the
wall
of
the
bedroom,
and
plucking
at
the
little
balls
which
edge
the
claret-coloured
curtain.
But
when
the
self
speaks
to
the
self,
who
is
speaking?—the
entombed
soul,
the
spirit
driven
in,
in,
in
to
the
central
catacomb;
the
self
that
took
the
veil
and
left
the
world—a
coward
perhaps,
yet
somehow
beautiful,
as
it
flits
with
its
lantern
restlessly
up
and
down
the
dark
corridors.
"I
can
bear
it
no
longer,"
her
spirit
says.
"That
man
at
lunch—Hilda—the
children."
Oh,
heavens,
her
sob!
It's
the
spirit
wailing
its
destiny,
the
spirit
driven
hither,
thither,
lodging
on
the
diminishing
carpets—meagre
footholds—shrunken
shreds
of
all
the
vanishing
universe—love,
life,
faith,
husband,
children,
I
know
not
what
splendours
and
pageantries
glimpsed
in
girlhood.
"Not
for
me—not
for
me."
But
then—the
muffins,
the
bald
elderly
dog?
Bead
mats
I
should
fancy
and
the
consolation
of
underlinen.
If
Minnie
Marsh
were
run
over
and
taken
to
hospital,
nurses
and
doctors
themselves
would
exclaim....
There's
the
vista
and
the
vision—there's
the
distance—the
blue
blot
at
the
end
of
the
avenue,
while,
after
all,
the
tea
is
rich,
the
muffin
hot,
and
the
dog—"Benny,
to
your
basket,
sir,
and
see
what
mother's
brought
you!"
So,
taking
the
glove
with
the
worn
thumb,
defying
once
more
the
encroaching
demon
of
what's
called
going
in
holes,
you
renew
the
fortifications,
threading
the
grey
wool,
running
it
in
and
out.
Running
it
in
and
out,
across
and
over,
spinning
a
web
through
which
God
himself—hush,
don't
think
of
God!
How
firm
the
stitches
are!
You
must
be
proud
of
your
darning.
Let
nothing
disturb
her.
Let
the
light
fall
gently,
and
the
clouds
show
an
inner
vest
of
the
first
green
leaf.
Let
the
sparrow
perch
on
the
twig
and
shake
the
raindrop
hanging
to
the
twig's
elbow....
Why
look
up?
Was
it
a
sound,
a
thought?
Oh,
heavens!
Back
again
to
the
thing
you
did,
the
plate
glass
with
the
violet
loops?
But
Hilda
will
come.
Ignominies,
humiliations,
oh!
Close
the
breach.
Having
mended
her
glove,
Minnie
Marsh
lays
it
in
the
drawer.
She
shuts
the
drawer
with
decision.
I
catch
sight
of
her
face
in
the
glass.
Lips
are
pursed.
Chin
held
high.
Next
she
laces
her
shoes.
Then
she
touches
her
throat.
What's
your
brooch?
Mistletoe
or
merry-thought?
And
what
is
happening?
Unless
I'm
much
mistaken,
the
pulse's
quickened,
the
moment's
coming,
the
threads
are
racing,
Niagara's
ahead.
Here's
the
crisis!
Heaven
be
with
you!
Down
she
goes.
Courage,
courage!
Face
it,
be
it!
For
God's
sake
don't
wait
on
the
mat
now!
There's
the
door!
I'm
on
your
side.
Speak!
Confront
her,
confound
her
soul!
"Oh,
I
beg
your
pardon!
Yes,
this
is
Eastbourne.
I'll
reach
it
down
for
you.
Let
me
try
the
handle."
[But,
Minnie,
though
we
keep
up
pretences,
I've
read
you
right—I'm
with
you
now].
"That's
all
your
luggage?"
"Much
obliged,
I'm
sure."
(But
why
do
you
look
about
you?
Hilda
won't
come
to
the
station,
nor
John;
and
Moggridge
is
driving
at
the
far
side
of
Eastbourne).
"I'll
wait
by
my
bag,
ma'am,
that's
safest.
He
said
he'd
meet
me....
Oh,
there
he
is!
That's
my
son."
So
they
walk
off
together.
Well,
but
I'm
confounded....
Surely,
Minnie,
you
know
better!
A
strange
young
man....
Stop!
I'll
tell
him—Minnie!—Miss
Marsh!—I
don't
know
though.
There's
something
queer
in
her
cloak
as
it
blows.
Oh,
but
it's
untrue,
it's
indecent....
Look
how
he
bends
as
they
reach
the
gateway.
She
finds
her
ticket.
What's
the
joke?
Off
they
go,
down
the
road,
side
by
side....
Well,
my
world's
done
for!
What
do
I
stand
on?
What
do
I
know?
That's
not
Minnie.
There
never
was
Moggridge.
Who
am
I?
Life's
bare
as
bone.
And
yet
the
last
look
of
them—he
stepping
from
the
kerb
and
she
following
him
round
the
edge
of
the
big
building
brims
me
with
wonder—floods
me
anew.
Mysterious
figures!
Mother
and
son.
Who
are
you?
Why
do
you
walk
down
the
street?
Where
to-night
will
you
sleep,
and
then,
to-morrow?
Oh,
how
it
whirls
and
surges—floats
me
afresh!
I
start
after
them.
People
drive
this
way
and
that.
The
white
light
splutters
and
pours.
Plate-glass
windows.
Carnations;
chrysanthemums.
Ivy
in
dark
gardens.
Milk
carts
at
the
door.
Wherever
I
go,
mysterious
figures,
I
see
you,
turning
the
corner,
mothers
and
sons;
you,
you,
you.
I
hasten,
I
follow.
This,
I
fancy,
must
be
the
sea.
Grey
is
the
landscape;
dim
as
ashes;
the
water
murmurs
and
moves.
If
I
fall
on
my
knees,
if
I
go
through
the
ritual,
the
ancient
antics,
it's
you,
unknown
figures,
you
I
adore;
if
I
open
my
arms,
it's
you
I
embrace,
you
I
draw
to
me—adorable
world!

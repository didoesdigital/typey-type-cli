Perhaps
it
was
the
middle
of
January
in
the
present
year
that
I
first
looked
up
and
saw
the
mark
on
the
wall.
In
order
to
fix
a
date
it
is
necessary
to
remember
what
one
saw.
So
now
I
think
of
the
fire;
the
steady
film
of
yellow
light
upon
the
page
of
my
book;
the
three
chrysanthemums
in
the
round
glass
bowl
on
the
mantelpiece.
Yes,
it
must
have
been
the
winter
time,
and
we
had
just
finished
our
tea,
for
I
remember
that
I
was
smoking
a
cigarette
when
I
looked
up
and
saw
the
mark
on
the
wall
for
the
first
time.
I
looked
up
through
the
smoke
of
my
cigarette
and
my
eye
lodged
for
a
moment
upon
the
burning
coals,
and
that
old
fancy
of
the
crimson
flag
flapping
from
the
castle
tower
came
into
my
mind,
and
I
thought
of
the
cavalcade
of
red
knights
riding
up
the
side
of
the
black
rock.
Rather
to
my
relief
the
sight
of
the
mark
interrupted
the
fancy,
for
it
is
an
old
fancy,
an
automatic
fancy,
made
as
a
child
perhaps.
The
mark
was
a
small
round
mark,
black
upon
the
white
wall,
about
six
or
seven
inches
above
the
mantelpiece.
How
readily
our
thoughts
swarm
upon
a
new
object,
lifting
it
a
little
way,
as
ants
carry
a
blade
of
straw
so
feverishly,
and
then
leave
it....
If
that
mark
was
made
by
a
nail,
it
can't
have
been
for
a
picture,
it
must
have
been
for
a
miniature—the
miniature
of
a
lady
with
white
powdered
curls,
powder-dusted
cheeks,
and
lips
like
red
carnations.
A
fraud
of
course,
for
the
people
who
had
this
house
before
us
would
have
chosen
pictures
in
that
way—an
old
picture
for
an
old
room.
That
is
the
sort
of
people
they
were—very
interesting
people,
and
I
think
of
them
so
often,
in
such
queer
places,
because
one
will
never
see
them
again,
never
know
what
happened
next.
They
wanted
to
leave
this
house
because
they
wanted
to
change
their
style
of
furniture,
so
he
said,
and
he
was
in
process
of
saying
that
in
his
opinion
art
should
have
ideas
behind
it
when
we
were
torn
asunder,
as
one
is
torn
from
the
old
lady
about
to
pour
out
tea
and
the
young
man
about
to
hit
the
tennis
ball
in
the
back
garden
of
the
suburban
villa
as
one
rushes
past
in
the
train.
But
as
for
that
mark,
I'm
not
sure
about
it;
I
don't
believe
it
was
made
by
a
nail
after
all;
it's
too
big,
too
round,
for
that.
I
might
get
up,
but
if
I
got
up
and
looked
at
it,
ten
to
one
I
shouldn't
be
able
to
say
for
certain;
because
once
a
thing's
done,
no
one
ever
knows
how
it
happened.
Oh!
dear
me,
the
mystery
of
life;
The
inaccuracy
of
thought!
The
ignorance
of
humanity!
To
show
how
very
little
control
of
our
possessions
we
have—what
an
accidental
affair
this
living
is
after
all
our
civilization—let
me
just
count
over
a
few
of
the
things
lost
in
one
lifetime,
beginning,
for
that
seems
always
the
most
mysterious
of
losses—what
cat
would
gnaw,
what
rat
would
nibble—three
pale
blue
canisters
of
book-binding
tools?
Then
there
were
the
bird
cages,
the
iron
hoops,
the
steel
skates,
the
Queen
Anne
coal-scuttle,
the
bagatelle
board,
the
hand
organ—all
gone,
and
jewels,
too.
Opals
and
emeralds,
they
lie
about
the
roots
of
turnips.
What
a
scraping
paring
affair
it
is
to
be
sure!
The
wonder
is
that
I've
any
clothes
on
my
back,
that
I
sit
surrounded
by
solid
furniture
at
this
moment.
Why,
if
one
wants
to
compare
life
to
anything,
one
must
liken
it
to
being
blown
through
the
Tube
at
fifty
miles
an
hour—landing
at
the
other
end
without
a
single
hairpin
in
one's
hair!
Shot
out
at
the
feet
of
God
entirely
naked!
Tumbling
head
over
heels
in
the
asphodel
meadows
like
brown
paper
parcels
pitched
down
a
shoot
in
the
post
office!
With
one's
hair
flying
back
like
the
tail
of
a
race-horse.
Yes,
that
seems
to
express
the
rapidity
of
life,
the
perpetual
waste
and
repair;
all
so
casual,
all
so
haphazard....
But
after
life.
The
slow
pulling
down
of
thick
green
stalks
so
that
the
cup
of
the
flower,
as
it
turns
over,
deluges
one
with
purple
and
red
light.
Why,
after
all,
should
one
not
be
born
there
as
one
is
born
here,
helpless,
speechless,
unable
to
focus
one's
eyesight,
groping
at
the
roots
of
the
grass,
at
the
toes
of
the
Giants?
As
for
saying
which
are
trees,
and
which
are
men
and
women,
or
whether
there
are
such
things,
that
one
won't
be
in
a
condition
to
do
for
fifty
years
or
so.
There
will
be
nothing
but
spaces
of
light
and
dark,
intersected
by
thick
stalks,
and
rather
higher
up
perhaps,
rose-shaped
blots
of
an
indistinct
colour—dim
pinks
and
blues—which
will,
as
time
goes
on,
become
more
definite,
become—I
don't
know
what....
And
yet
that
mark
on
the
wall
is
not
a
hole
at
all.
It
may
even
be
caused
by
some
round
black
substance,
such
as
a
small
rose
leaf,
left
over
from
the
summer,
and
I,
not
being
a
very
vigilant
housekeeper—look
at
the
dust
on
the
mantelpiece,
for
example,
the
dust
which,
so
they
say,
buried
Troy
three
times
over,
only
fragments
of
pots
utterly
refusing
annihilation,
as
one
can
believe.
The
tree
outside
the
window
taps
very
gently
on
the
pane....
I
want
to
think
quietly,
calmly,
spaciously,
never
to
be
interrupted,
never
to
have
to
rise
from
my
chair,
to
slip
easily
from
one
thing
to
another,
without
any
sense
of
hostility,
or
obstacle.
I
want
to
sink
deeper
and
deeper,
away
from
the
surface,
with
its
hard
separate
facts.
To
steady
myself,
let
me
catch
hold
of
the
first
idea
that
passes....
Shakespeare....
Well,
he
will
do
as
well
as
another.
A
man
who
sat
himself
solidly
in
an
arm-chair,
and
looked
into
the
fire,
so—A
shower
of
ideas
fell
perpetually
from
some
very
high
Heaven
down
through
his
mind.
He
leant
his
forehead
on
his
hand,
and
people,
looking
in
through
the
open
door,—for
this
scene
is
supposed
to
take
place
on
a
summer's
evening—But
how
dull
this
is,
this
historical
fiction!
It
doesn't
interest
me
at
all.
I
wish
I
could
hit
upon
a
pleasant
track
of
thought,
a
track
indirectly
reflecting
credit
upon
myself,
for
those
are
the
pleasantest
thoughts,
and
very
frequent
even
in
the
minds
of
modest
mouse-coloured
people,
who
believe
genuinely
that
they
dislike
to
hear
their
own
praises.
They
are
not
thoughts
directly
praising
oneself;
that
is
the
beauty
of
them;
they
are
thoughts
like
this:
"And
then
I
came
into
the
room.
They
were
discussing
botany.
I
said
how
I'd
seen
a
flower
growing
on
a
dust
heap
on
the
site
of
an
old
house
in
Kingsway.
The
seed,
I
said,
must
have
been
sown
in
the
reign
of
Charles
the
First.
What
flowers
grew
in
the
reign
of
Charles
the
First?"
I
asked—(but
I
don't
remember
the
answer).
Tall
flowers
with
purple
tassels
to
them
perhaps.
And
so
it
goes
on.
All
the
time
I'm
dressing
up
the
figure
of
myself
in
my
own
mind,
lovingly,
stealthily,
not
openly
adoring
it,
for
if
I
did
that,
I
should
catch
myself
out,
and
stretch
my
hand
at
once
for
a
book
in
self-protection.
Indeed,
it
is
curious
how
instinctively
one
protects
the
image
of
oneself
from
idolatry
or
any
other
handling
that
could
make
it
ridiculous,
or
too
unlike
the
original
to
be
believed
in
any
longer.
Or
is
it
not
so
very
curious
after
all?
It
is
a
matter
of
great
importance.
Suppose
the
looking
glass
smashes,
the
image
disappears,
and
the
romantic
figure
with
the
green
of
forest
depths
all
about
it
is
there
no
longer,
but
only
that
shell
of
a
person
which
is
seen
by
other
people—what
an
airless,
shallow,
bald,
prominent
world
it
becomes!
A
world
not
to
be
lived
in.
As
we
face
each
other
in
omnibuses
and
underground
railways
we
are
looking
into
the
mirror;
that
accounts
for
the
vagueness,
the
gleam
of
glassiness,
in
our
eyes.
And
the
novelists
in
future
will
realize
more
and
more
the
importance
of
these
reflections,
for
of
course
there
is
not
one
reflection
but
an
almost
infinite
number;
those
are
the
depths
they
will
explore,
those
the
phantoms
they
will
pursue,
leaving
the
description
of
reality
more
and
more
out
of
their
stories,
taking
a
knowledge
of
it
for
granted,
as
the
Greeks
did
and
Shakespeare
perhaps—but
these
generalizations
are
very
worthless.
The
military
sound
of
the
word
is
enough.
It
recalls
leading
articles,
cabinet
ministers—a
whole
class
of
things
indeed
which
as
a
child
one
thought
the
thing
itself,
the
standard
thing,
the
real
thing,
from
which
one
could
not
depart
save
at
the
risk
of
nameless
damnation.
Generalizations
bring
back
somehow
Sunday
in
London,
Sunday
afternoon
walks,
Sunday
luncheons,
and
also
ways
of
speaking
of
the
dead,
clothes,
and
habits—like
the
habit
of
sitting
all
together
in
one
room
until
a
certain
hour,
although
nobody
liked
it.
There
was
a
rule
for
everything.
The
rule
for
tablecloths
at
that
particular
period
was
that
they
should
be
made
of
tapestry
with
little
yellow
compartments
marked
upon
them,
such
as
you
may
see
in
photographs
of
the
carpets
in
the
corridors
of
the
royal
palaces.
Tablecloths
of
a
different
kind
were
not
real
tablecloths.
How
shocking,
and
yet
how
wonderful
it
was
to
discover
that
these
real
things,
Sunday
luncheons,
Sunday
walks,
country
houses,
and
tablecloths
were
not
entirely
real,
were
indeed
half
phantoms,
and
the
damnation
which
visited
the
disbeliever
in
them
was
only
a
sense
of
illegitimate
freedom.
What
now
takes
the
place
of
those
things
I
wonder,
those
real
standard
things?
Men
perhaps,
should
you
be
a
woman;
the
masculine
point
of
view
which
governs
our
lives,
which
sets
the
standard,
which
establishes
Whitaker's
Table
of
Precedency,
which
has
become,
I
suppose,
since
the
war
half
a
phantom
to
many
men
and
women,
which
soon,
one
may
hope,
will
be
laughed
into
the
dustbin
where
the
phantoms
go,
the
mahogany
sideboards
and
the
Landseer
prints,
Gods
and
Devils,
Hell
and
so
forth,
leaving
us
all
with
an
intoxicating
sense
of
illegitimate
freedom—if
freedom
exists....
In
certain
lights
that
mark
on
the
wall
seems
actually
to
project
from
the
wall.
Nor
is
it
entirely
circular.
I
cannot
be
sure,
but
it
seems
to
cast
a
perceptible
shadow,
suggesting
that
if
I
ran
my
finger
down
that
strip
of
the
wall
it
would,
at
a
certain
point,
mount
and
descend
a
small
tumulus,
a
smooth
tumulus
like
those
barrows
on
the
South
Downs
which
are,
they
say,
either
tombs
or
camps.
Of
the
two
I
should
prefer
them
to
be
tombs,
desiring
melancholy
like
most
English
people,
and
finding
it
natural
at
the
end
of
a
walk
to
think
of
the
bones
stretched
beneath
the
turf....
There
must
be
some
book
about
it.
Some
antiquary
must
have
dug
up
those
bones
and
given
them
a
name....
What
sort
of
a
man
is
an
antiquary,
I
wonder?
Retired
Colonels
for
the
most
part,
I
daresay,
leading
parties
of
aged
labourers
to
the
top
here,
examining
clods
of
earth
and
stone,
and
getting
into
correspondence
with
the
neighbouring
clergy,
which,
being
opened
at
breakfast
time,
gives
them
a
feeling
of
importance,
and
the
comparison
of
arrow-heads
necessitates
cross-country
journeys
to
the
county
towns,
an
agreeable
necessity
both
to
them
and
to
their
elderly
wives,
who
wish
to
make
plum
jam
or
to
clean
out
the
study,
and
have
every
reason
for
keeping
that
great
question
of
the
camp
or
the
tomb
in
perpetual
suspension,
while
the
Colonel
himself
feels
agreeably
philosophic
in
accumulating
evidence
on
both
sides
of
the
question.
It
is
true
that
he
does
finally
incline
to
believe
in
the
camp;
and,
being
opposed,
indites
a
pamphlet
which
he
is
about
to
read
at
the
quarterly
meeting
of
the
local
society
when
a
stroke
lays
him
low,
and
his
last
conscious
thoughts
are
not
of
wife
or
child,
but
of
the
camp
and
that
arrowhead
there,
which
is
now
in
the
case
at
the
local
museum,
together
with
the
foot
of
a
Chinese
murderess,
a
handful
of
Elizabethan
nails,
a
great
many
Tudor
clay
pipes,
a
piece
of
Roman
pottery,
and
the
wine-glass
that
Nelson
drank
out
of—proving
I
really
don't
know
what.
No,
no,
nothing
is
proved,
nothing
is
known.
And
if
I
were
to
get
up
at
this
very
moment
and
ascertain
that
the
mark
on
the
wall
is
really—what
shall
we
say?—the
head
of
a
gigantic
old
nail,
driven
in
two
hundred
years
ago,
which
has
now,
owing
to
the
patient
attrition
of
many
generations
of
housemaids,
revealed
its
head
above
the
coat
of
paint,
and
is
taking
its
first
view
of
modern
life
in
the
sight
of
a
white-walled
fire-lit
room,
what
should
I
gain?—Knowledge?
Matter
for
further
speculation?
I
can
think
sitting
still
as
well
as
standing
up.
And
what
is
knowledge?
What
are
our
learned
men
save
the
descendants
of
witches
and
hermits
who
crouched
in
caves
and
in
woods
brewing
herbs,
interrogating
shrew-mice
and
writing
down
the
language
of
the
stars?
And
the
less
we
honour
them
as
our
superstitions
dwindle
and
our
respect
for
beauty
and
health
of
mind
increases....
Yes,
one
could
imagine
a
very
pleasant
world.
A
quiet,
spacious
world,
with
the
flowers
so
red
and
blue
in
the
open
fields.
A
world
without
professors
or
specialists
or
house-keepers
with
the
profiles
of
policemen,
a
world
which
one
could
slice
with
one's
thought
as
a
fish
slices
the
water
with
his
fin,
grazing
the
stems
of
the
water-lilies,
hanging
suspended
over
nests
of
white
sea
eggs....
How
peaceful
it
is
down
here,
rooted
in
the
centre
of
the
world
and
gazing
up
through
the
grey
waters,
with
their
sudden
gleams
of
light,
and
their
reflections—if
it
were
not
for
Whitaker's
Almanack—if
it
were
not
for
the
Table
of
Precedency!
I
must
jump
up
and
see
for
myself
what
that
mark
on
the
wall
really
is—a
nail,
a
rose-leaf,
a
crack
in
the
wood?
Here
is
nature
once
more
at
her
old
game
of
self-preservation.
This
train
of
thought,
she
perceives,
is
threatening
mere
waste
of
energy,
even
some
collision
with
reality,
for
who
will
ever
be
able
to
lift
a
finger
against
Whitaker's
Table
of
Precedency?
The
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
is
followed
by
the
Lord
High
Chancellor;
the
Lord
High
Chancellor
is
followed
by
the
Archbishop
of
York.
Everybody
follows
somebody,
such
is
the
philosophy
of
Whitaker;
and
the
great
thing
is
to
know
who
follows
whom.
Whitaker
knows,
and
let
that,
so
Nature
counsels,
comfort
you,
instead
of
enraging
you;
and
if
you
can't
be
comforted,
if
you
must
shatter
this
hour
of
peace,
think
of
the
mark
on
the
wall.
I
understand
Nature's
game—her
prompting
to
take
action
as
a
way
of
ending
any
thought
that
threatens
to
excite
or
to
pain.
Hence,
I
suppose,
comes
our
slight
contempt
for
men
of
action—men,
we
assume,
who
don't
think.
Still,
there's
no
harm
in
putting
a
full
stop
to
one's
disagreeable
thoughts
by
looking
at
a
mark
on
the
wall.
Indeed,
now
that
I
have
fixed
my
eyes
upon
it,
I
feel
that
I
have
grasped
a
plank
in
the
sea;
I
feel
a
satisfying
sense
of
reality
which
at
once
turns
the
two
Archbishops
and
the
Lord
High
Chancellor
to
the
shadows
of
shades.
Here
is
something
definite,
something
real.
Thus,
waking
from
a
midnight
dream
of
horror,
one
hastily
turns
on
the
light
and
lies
quiescent,
worshipping
the
chest
of
drawers,
worshipping
solidity,
worshipping
reality,
worshipping
the
impersonal
world
which
is
a
proof
of
some
existence
other
than
ours.
That
is
what
one
wants
to
be
sure
of....
Wood
is
a
pleasant
thing
to
think
about.
It
comes
from
a
tree;
and
trees
grow,
and
we
don't
know
how
they
grow.
For
years
and
years
they
grow,
without
paying
any
attention
to
us,
in
meadows,
in
forests,
and
by
the
side
of
rivers—all
things
one
likes
to
think
about.
The
cows
swish
their
tails
beneath
them
on
hot
afternoons;
they
paint
rivers
so
green
that
when
a
moorhen
dives
one
expects
to
see
its
feathers
all
green
when
it
comes
up
again.
I
like
to
think
of
the
fish
balanced
against
the
stream
like
flags
blown
out;
and
of
water-beetles
slowly
raising
domes
of
mud
upon
the
bed
of
the
river.
I
like
to
think
of
the
tree
itself:
first
the
close
dry
sensation
of
being
wood;
then
the
grinding
of
the
storm;
then
the
slow,
delicious
ooze
of
sap.
I
like
to
think
of
it,
too,
on
winter's
nights
standing
in
the
empty
field
with
all
leaves
close-furled,
nothing
tender
exposed
to
the
iron
bullets
of
the
moon,
a
naked
mast
upon
an
earth
that
goes
tumbling,
tumbling,
all
night
long.
The
song
of
birds
must
sound
very
loud
and
strange
in
June;
and
how
cold
the
feet
of
insects
must
feel
upon
it,
as
they
make
laborious
progresses
up
the
creases
of
the
bark,
or
sun
themselves
upon
the
thin
green
awning
of
the
leaves,
and
look
straight
in
front
of
them
with
diamond-cut
red
eyes....
One
by
one
the
fibres
snap
beneath
the
immense
cold
pressure
of
the
earth,
then
the
last
storm
comes
and,
falling,
the
highest
branches
drive
deep
into
the
ground
again.
Even
so,
life
isn't
done
with;
there
are
a
million
patient,
watchful
lives
still
for
a
tree,
all
over
the
world,
in
bedrooms,
in
ships,
on
the
pavement,
lining
rooms,
where
men
and
women
sit
after
tea,
smoking
cigarettes.
It
is
full
of
peaceful
thoughts,
happy
thoughts,
this
tree.
I
should
like
to
take
each
one
separately—but
something
is
getting
in
the
way....
Where
was
I?
What
has
it
all
been
about?
A
tree?
A
river?
The
Downs?
Whitaker's
Almanack?
The
fields
of
asphodel?
I
can't
remember
a
thing.
Everything's
moving,
falling,
slipping,
vanishing....
There
is
a
vast
upheaval
of
matter.
Someone
is
standing
over
me
and
saying—
"I'm
going
out
to
buy
a
newspaper."
"Yes?"
"Though
it's
no
good
buying
newspapers....
Nothing
ever
happens.
Curse
this
war;
God
damn
this
war!...
All
the
same,
I
don't
see
why
we
should
have
a
snail
on
our
wall."
Ah,
the
mark
on
the
wall!
It
was
a
snail.

Well,
here
we
are,
and
if
you
cast
your
eye
over
the
room
you
will
see
that
Tubes
and
trams
and
omnibuses,
private
carriages
not
a
few,
even,
I
venture
to
believe,
landaus
with
bays
in
them,
have
been
busy
at
it,
weaving
threads
from
one
end
of
London
to
the
other.
Yet
I
begin
to
have
my
doubts—
If
indeed
it's
true,
as
they're
saying,
that
Regent
Street
is
up,
and
the
Treaty
signed,
and
the
weather
not
cold
for
the
time
of
year,
and
even
at
that
rent
not
a
flat
to
be
had,
and
the
worst
of
influenza
its
after
effects;
if
I
bethink
me
of
having
forgotten
to
write
about
the
leak
in
the
larder,
and
left
my
glove
in
the
train;
if
the
ties
of
blood
require
me,
leaning
forward,
to
accept
cordially
the
hand
which
is
perhaps
offered
hesitatingly—
"Seven
years
since
we
met!"
"The
last
time
in
Venice."
"And
where
are
you
living
now?"
"Well,
the
late
afternoon
suits
me
the
best,
though,
if
it
weren't
asking
too
much——"
"But
I
knew
you
at
once!"
"Still,
the
war
made
a
break——"
If
the
mind's
shot
through
by
such
little
arrows,
and—for
human
society
compels
it—no
sooner
is
one
launched
than
another
presses
forward;
if
this
engenders
heat
and
in
addition
they've
turned
on
the
electric
light;
if
saying
one
thing
does,
in
so
many
cases,
leave
behind
it
a
need
to
improve
and
revise,
stirring
besides
regrets,
pleasures,
vanities,
and
desires—if
it's
all
the
facts
I
mean,
and
the
hats,
the
fur
boas,
the
gentlemen's
swallow-tail
coats,
and
pearl
tie-pins
that
come
to
the
surface—what
chance
is
there?
Of
what?
It
becomes
every
minute
more
difficult
to
say
why,
in
spite
of
everything,
I
sit
here
believing
I
can't
now
say
what,
or
even
remember
the
last
time
it
happened.
"Did
you
see
the
procession?"
"The
King
looked
cold."
"No,
no,
no.
But
what
was
it?"
"She's
bought
a
house
at
Malmesbury."
"How
lucky
to
find
one!"
On
the
contrary,
it
seems
to
me
pretty
sure
that
she,
whoever
she
may
be,
is
damned,
since
it's
all
a
matter
of
flats
and
hats
and
sea
gulls,
or
so
it
seems
to
be
for
a
hundred
people
sitting
here
well
dressed,
walled
in,
furred,
replete.
Not
that
I
can
boast,
since
I
too
sit
passive
on
a
gilt
chair,
only
turning
the
earth
above
a
buried
memory,
as
we
all
do,
for
there
are
signs,
if
I'm
not
mistaken,
that
we're
all
recalling
something,
furtively
seeking
something.
Why
fidget?
Why
so
anxious
about
the
sit
of
cloaks;
and
gloves—whether
to
button
or
unbutton?
Then
watch
that
elderly
face
against
the
dark
canvas,
a
moment
ago
urbane
and
flushed;
now
taciturn
and
sad,
as
if
in
shadow.
Was
it
the
sound
of
the
second
violin
tuning
in
the
ante-room?
Here
they
come;
four
black
figures,
carrying
instruments,
and
seat
themselves
facing
the
white
squares
under
the
downpour
of
light;
rest
the
tips
of
their
bows
on
the
music
stand;
with
a
simultaneous
movement
lift
them;
lightly
poise
them,
and,
looking
across
at
the
player
opposite,
the
first
violin
counts
one,
two,
three——
Flourish,
spring,
burgeon,
burst!
The
pear
tree
on
the
top
of
the
mountain.
Fountains
jet;
drops
descend.
But
the
waters
of
the
Rhone
flow
swift
and
deep,
race
under
the
arches,
and
sweep
the
trailing
water
leaves,
washing
shadows
over
the
silver
fish,
the
spotted
fish
rushed
down
by
the
swift
waters,
now
swept
into
an
eddy
where—it's
difficult
this—conglomeration
of
fish
all
in
a
pool;
leaping,
splashing,
scraping
sharp
fins;
and
such
a
boil
of
current
that
the
yellow
pebbles
are
churned
round
and
round,
round
and
round—free
now,
rushing
downwards,
or
even
somehow
ascending
in
exquisite
spirals
into
the
air;
curled
like
thin
shavings
from
under
a
plane;
up
and
up....
How
lovely
goodness
is
in
those
who,
stepping
lightly,
go
smiling
through
the
world!
Also
in
jolly
old
fishwives,
squatted
under
arches,
obscene
old
women,
how
deeply
they
laugh
and
shake
and
rollick,
when
they
walk,
from
side
to
side,
hum,
hah!
"That's
an
early
Mozart,
of
course——"
"But
the
tune,
like
all
his
tunes,
makes
one
despair—I
mean
hope.
What
do
I
mean?
That's
the
worst
of
music!
I
want
to
dance,
laugh,
eat
pink
cakes,
yellow
cakes,
drink
thin,
sharp
wine.
Or
an
indecent
story,
now—I
could
relish
that.
The
older
one
grows
the
more
one
likes
indecency.
Hah,
hah!
I'm
laughing.
What
at?
You
said
nothing,
nor
did
the
old
gentleman
opposite....
But
suppose—suppose—Hush!"
The
melancholy
river
bears
us
on.
When
the
moon
comes
through
the
trailing
willow
boughs,
I
see
your
face,
I
hear
your
voice
and
the
bird
singing
as
we
pass
the
osier
bed.
What
are
you
whispering?
Sorrow,
sorrow.
Joy,
joy.
Woven
together,
like
reeds
in
moonlight.
Woven
together,
inextricably
commingled,
bound
in
pain
and
strewn
in
sorrow—crash!
The
boat
sinks.
Rising,
the
figures
ascend,
but
now
leaf
thin,
tapering
to
a
dusky
wraith,
which,
fiery
tipped,
draws
its
twofold
passion
from
my
heart.
For
me
it
sings,
unseals
my
sorrow,
thaws
compassion,
floods
with
love
the
sunless
world,
nor,
ceasing,
abates
its
tenderness
but
deftly,
subtly,
weaves
in
and
out
until
in
this
pattern,
this
consummation,
the
cleft
ones
unify;
soar,
sob,
sink
to
rest,
sorrow
and
joy.
Why
then
grieve?
Ask
what?
Remain
unsatisfied?
I
say
all's
been
settled;
yes;
laid
to
rest
under
a
coverlet
of
rose
leaves,
falling.
Falling.
Ah,
but
they
cease.
One
rose
leaf,
falling
from
an
enormous
height,
like
a
little
parachute
dropped
from
an
invisible
balloon,
turns,
flutters
waveringly.
It
won't
reach
us.
"No,
no.
I
noticed
nothing.
That's
the
worst
of
music—these
silly
dreams.
The
second
violin
was
late,
you
say?"
"There's
old
Mrs.
Munro,
feeling
her
way
out—blinder
each
year,
poor
woman—on
this
slippery
floor."
Eyeless
old
age,
grey-headed
Sphinx....
There
she
stands
on
the
pavement,
beckoning,
so
sternly,
the
red
omnibus.
"How
lovely!
How
well
they
play!
How—how—how!"
The
tongue
is
but
a
clapper.
Simplicity
itself.
The
feathers
in
the
hat
next
me
are
bright
and
pleasing
as
a
child's
rattle.
The
leaf
on
the
plane-tree
flashes
green
through
the
chink
in
the
curtain.
Very
strange,
very
exciting.
"How—how—how!"
Hush!
These
are
the
lovers
on
the
grass.
"If,
madam,
you
will
take
my
hand——"
"Sir,
I
would
trust
you
with
my
heart.
Moreover,
we
have
left
our
bodies
in
the
banqueting
hall.
Those
on
the
turf
are
the
shadows
of
our
souls."
"Then
these
are
the
embraces
of
our
souls."
The
lemons
nod
assent.
The
swan
pushes
from
the
bank
and
floats
dreaming
into
mid
stream.
"But
to
return.
He
followed
me
down
the
corridor,
and,
as
we
turned
the
corner,
trod
on
the
lace
of
my
petticoat.
What
could
I
do
but
cry
'Ah!'
and
stop
to
finger
it?
At
which
he
drew
his
sword,
made
passes
as
if
he
were
stabbing
something
to
death,
and
cried,
'Mad!
Mad!
Mad!'
Whereupon
I
screamed,
and
the
Prince,
who
was
writing
in
the
large
vellum
book
in
the
oriel
window,
came
out
in
his
velvet
skull-cap
and
furred
slippers,
snatched
a
rapier
from
the
wall—the
King
of
Spain's
gift,
you
know—on
which
I
escaped,
flinging
on
this
cloak
to
hide
the
ravages
to
my
skirt—to
hide....
But
listen!
the
horns!"
The
gentleman
replies
so
fast
to
the
lady,
and
she
runs
up
the
scale
with
such
witty
exchange
of
compliment
now
culminating
in
a
sob
of
passion,
that
the
words
are
indistinguishable
though
the
meaning
is
plain
enough—love,
laughter,
flight,
pursuit,
celestial
bliss—all
floated
out
on
the
gayest
ripple
of
tender
endearment—until
the
sound
of
the
silver
horns,
at
first
far
distant,
gradually
sounds
more
and
more
distinctly,
as
if
seneschals
were
saluting
the
dawn
or
proclaiming
ominously
the
escape
of
the
lovers....
The
green
garden,
moonlit
pool,
lemons,
lovers,
and
fish
are
all
dissolved
in
the
opal
sky,
across
which,
as
the
horns
are
joined
by
trumpets
and
supported
by
clarions
there
rise
white
arches
firmly
planted
on
marble
pillars....
Tramp
and
trumpeting.
Clang
and
clangour.
Firm
establishment.
Fast
foundations.
March
of
myriads.
Confusion
and
chaos
trod
to
earth.
But
this
city
to
which
we
travel
has
neither
stone
nor
marble;
hangs
enduring;
stands
unshakable;
nor
does
a
face,
nor
does
a
flag
greet
or
welcome.
Leave
then
to
perish
your
hope;
droop
in
the
desert
my
joy;
naked
advance.
Bare
are
the
pillars;
auspicious
to
none;
casting
no
shade;
resplendent;
severe.
Back
then
I
fall,
eager
no
more,
desiring
only
to
go,
find
the
street,
mark
the
buildings,
greet
the
applewoman,
say
to
the
maid
who
opens
the
door:
A
starry
night.
"Good
night,
good
night.
You
go
this
way?"
"Alas.
I
go
that."

From
the
oval-shaped
flower-bed
there
rose
perhaps
a
hundred
stalks
spreading
into
heart-shaped
or
tongue-shaped
leaves
half
way
up
and
unfurling
at
the
tip
red
or
blue
or
yellow
petals
marked
with
spots
of
colour
raised
upon
the
surface;
and
from
the
red,
blue
or
yellow
gloom
of
the
throat
emerged
a
straight
bar,
rough
with
gold
dust
and
slightly
clubbed
at
the
end.
The
petals
were
voluminous
enough
to
be
stirred
by
the
summer
breeze,
and
when
they
moved,
the
red,
blue
and
yellow
lights
passed
one
over
the
other,
staining
an
inch
of
the
brown
earth
beneath
with
a
spot
of
the
most
intricate
colour.
The
light
fell
either
upon
the
smooth,
grey
back
of
a
pebble,
or,
the
shell
of
a
snail
with
its
brown,
circular
veins,
or
falling
into
a
raindrop,
it
expanded
with
such
intensity
of
red,
blue
and
yellow
the
thin
walls
of
water
that
one
expected
them
to
burst
and
disappear.
Instead,
the
drop
was
left
in
a
second
silver
grey
once
more,
and
the
light
now
settled
upon
the
flesh
of
a
leaf,
revealing
the
branching
thread
of
fibre
beneath
the
surface,
and
again
it
moved
on
and
spread
its
illumination
in
the
vast
green
spaces
beneath
the
dome
of
the
heart-shaped
and
tongue-shaped
leaves.
Then
the
breeze
stirred
rather
more
briskly
overhead
and
the
colour
was
flashed
into
the
air
above,
into
the
eyes
of
the
men
and
women
who
walk
in
Kew
Gardens
in
July.
The
figures
of
these
men
and
women
straggled
past
the
flower-bed
with
a
curiously
irregular
movement
not
unlike
that
of
the
white
and
blue
butterflies
who
crossed
the
turf
in
zig-zag
flights
from
bed
to
bed.
The
man
was
about
six
inches
in
front
of
the
woman,
strolling
carelessly,
while
she
bore
on
with
greater
purpose,
only
turning
her
head
now
and
then
to
see
that
the
children
were
not
too
far
behind.
The
man
kept
this
distance
in
front
of
the
woman
purposely,
though
perhaps
unconsciously,
for
he
wished
to
go
on
with
his
thoughts.
"Fifteen
years
ago
I
came
here
with
Lily,"
he
thought.
"We
sat
somewhere
over
there
by
a
lake
and
I
begged
her
to
marry
me
all
through
the
hot
afternoon.
How
the
dragonfly
kept
circling
round
us:
how
clearly
I
see
the
dragonfly
and
her
shoe
with
the
square
silver
buckle
at
the
toe.
All
the
time
I
spoke
I
saw
her
shoe
and
when
it
moved
impatiently
I
knew
without
looking
up
what
she
was
going
to
say:
the
whole
of
her
seemed
to
be
in
her
shoe.
And
my
love,
my
desire,
were
in
the
dragonfly;
for
some
reason
I
thought
that
if
it
settled
there,
on
that
leaf,
the
broad
one
with
the
red
flower
in
the
middle
of
it,
if
the
dragonfly
settled
on
the
leaf
she
would
say
"Yes"
at
once.
But
the
dragonfly
went
round
and
round:
it
never
settled
anywhere—of
course
not,
happily
not,
or
I
shouldn't
be
walking
here
with
Eleanor
and
the
children—Tell
me,
Eleanor.
D'you
ever
think
of
the
past?"
"Why
do
you
ask,
Simon?"
"Because
I've
been
thinking
of
the
past.
I've
been
thinking
of
Lily,
the
woman
I
might
have
married....
Well,
why
are
you
silent?
Do
you
mind
my
thinking
of
the
past?"
"Why
should
I
mind,
Simon?
Doesn't
one
always
think
of
the
past,
in
a
garden
with
men
and
women
lying
under
the
trees?
Aren't
they
one's
past,
all
that
remains
of
it,
those
men
and
women,
those
ghosts
lying
under
the
trees,
...
one's
happiness,
one's
reality?"
"For
me,
a
square
silver
shoe
buckle
and
a
dragonfly—"
"For
me,
a
kiss.
Imagine
six
little
girls
sitting
before
their
easels
twenty
years
ago,
down
by
the
side
of
a
lake,
painting
the
water-lilies,
the
first
red
water-lilies
I'd
ever
seen.
And
suddenly
a
kiss,
there
on
the
back
of
my
neck.
And
my
hand
shook
all
the
afternoon
so
that
I
couldn't
paint.
I
took
out
my
watch
and
marked
the
hour
when
I
would
allow
myself
to
think
of
the
kiss
for
five
minutes
only—it
was
so
precious—the
kiss
of
an
old
grey-haired
woman
with
a
wart
on
her
nose,
the
mother
of
all
my
kisses
all
my
life.
Come,
Caroline,
come,
Hubert."
They
walked
on
past
the
flower-bed,
now
walking
four
abreast,
and
soon
diminished
in
size
among
the
trees
and
looked
half
transparent
as
the
sunlight
and
shade
swam
over
their
backs
in
large
trembling
irregular
patches.
In
the
oval
flower
bed
the
snail,
whose
shell
had
been
stained
red,
blue,
and
yellow
for
the
space
of
two
minutes
or
so,
now
appeared
to
be
moving
very
slightly
in
its
shell,
and
next
began
to
labour
over
the
crumbs
of
loose
earth
which
broke
away
and
rolled
down
as
it
passed
over
them.
It
appeared
to
have
a
definite
goal
in
front
of
it,
differing
in
this
respect
from
the
singular
high
stepping
angular
green
insect
who
attempted
to
cross
in
front
of
it,
and
waited
for
a
second
with
its
antennæ
trembling
as
if
in
deliberation,
and
then
stepped
off
as
rapidly
and
strangely
in
the
opposite
direction.
Brown
cliffs
with
deep
green
lakes
in
the
hollows,
flat,
blade-like
trees
that
waved
from
root
to
tip,
round
boulders
of
grey
stone,
vast
crumpled
surfaces
of
a
thin
crackling
texture—all
these
objects
lay
across
the
snail's
progress
between
one
stalk
and
another
to
his
goal.
Before
he
had
decided
whether
to
circumvent
the
arched
tent
of
a
dead
leaf
or
to
breast
it
there
came
past
the
bed
the
feet
of
other
human
beings.
This
time
they
were
both
men.
The
younger
of
the
two
wore
an
expression
of
perhaps
unnatural
calm;
he
raised
his
eyes
and
fixed
them
very
steadily
in
front
of
him
while
his
companion
spoke,
and
directly
his
companion
had
done
speaking
he
looked
on
the
ground
again
and
sometimes
opened
his
lips
only
after
a
long
pause
and
sometimes
did
not
open
them
at
all.
The
elder
man
had
a
curiously
uneven
and
shaky
method
of
walking,
jerking
his
hand
forward
and
throwing
up
his
head
abruptly,
rather
in
the
manner
of
an
impatient
carriage
horse
tired
of
waiting
outside
a
house;
but
in
the
man
these
gestures
were
irresolute
and
pointless.
He
talked
almost
incessantly;
he
smiled
to
himself
and
again
began
to
talk,
as
if
the
smile
had
been
an
answer.
He
was
talking
about
spirits—the
spirits
of
the
dead,
who,
according
to
him,
were
even
now
telling
him
all
sorts
of
odd
things
about
their
experiences
in
Heaven.
"Heaven
was
known
to
the
ancients
as
Thessaly,
William,
and
now,
with
this
war,
the
spirit
matter
is
rolling
between
the
hills
like
thunder."
He
paused,
seemed
to
listen,
smiled,
jerked
his
head
and
continued:—
"You
have
a
small
electric
battery
and
a
piece
of
rubber
to
insulate
the
wire—isolate?—insulate?—well,
we'll
skip
the
details,
no
good
going
into
details
that
wouldn't
be
understood—and
in
short
the
little
machine
stands
in
any
convenient
position
by
the
head
of
the
bed,
we
will
say,
on
a
neat
mahogany
stand.
All
arrangements
being
properly
fixed
by
workmen
under
my
direction,
the
widow
applies
her
ear
and
summons
the
spirit
by
sign
as
agreed.
Women!
Widows!
Women
in
black——"
Here
he
seemed
to
have
caught
sight
of
a
woman's
dress
in
the
distance,
which
in
the
shade
looked
a
purple
black.
He
took
off
his
hat,
placed
his
hand
upon
his
heart,
and
hurried
towards
her
muttering
and
gesticulating
feverishly.
But
William
caught
him
by
the
sleeve
and
touched
a
flower
with
the
tip
of
his
walking-stick
in
order
to
divert
the
old
man's
attention.
After
looking
at
it
for
a
moment
in
some
confusion
the
old
man
bent
his
ear
to
it
and
seemed
to
answer
a
voice
speaking
from
it,
for
he
began
talking
about
the
forests
of
Uruguay
which
he
had
visited
hundreds
of
years
ago
in
company
with
the
most
beautiful
young
woman
in
Europe.
He
could
be
heard
murmuring
about
forests
of
Uruguay
blanketed
with
the
wax
petals
of
tropical
roses,
nightingales,
sea
beaches,
mermaids,
and
women
drowned
at
sea,
as
he
suffered
himself
to
be
moved
on
by
William,
upon
whose
face
the
look
of
stoical
patience
grew
slowly
deeper
and
deeper.
Following
his
steps
so
closely
as
to
be
slightly
puzzled
by
his
gestures
came
two
elderly
women
of
the
lower
middle
class,
one
stout
and
ponderous,
the
other
rosy
cheeked
and
nimble.
Like
most
people
of
their
station
they
were
frankly
fascinated
by
any
signs
of
eccentricity
betokening
a
disordered
brain,
especially
in
the
well-to-do;
but
they
were
too
far
off
to
be
certain
whether
the
gestures
were
merely
eccentric
or
genuinely
mad.
After
they
had
scrutinised
the
old
man's
back
in
silence
for
a
moment
and
given
each
other
a
queer,
sly
look,
they
went
on
energetically
piecing
together
their
very
complicated
dialogue:
"Nell,
Bert,
Lot,
Cess,
Phil,
Pa,
he
says,
I
says,
she
says,
I
says,
I
says,
I
says——"
"My
Bert,
Sis,
Bill,
Grandad,
the
old
man,
sugar,
Sugar,
flour,
kippers,
greens,
Sugar,
sugar,
sugar."
The
ponderous
woman
looked
through
the
pattern
of
falling
words
at
the
flowers
standing
cool,
firm,
and
upright
in
the
earth,
with
a
curious
expression.
She
saw
them
as
a
sleeper
waking
from
a
heavy
sleep
sees
a
brass
candlestick
reflecting
the
light
in
an
unfamiliar
way,
and
closes
his
eyes
and
opens
them,
and
seeing
the
brass
candlestick
again,
finally
starts
broad
awake
and
stares
at
the
candlestick
with
all
his
powers.
So
the
heavy
woman
came
to
a
standstill
opposite
the
oval-shaped
flower
bed,
and
ceased
even
to
pretend
to
listen
to
what
the
other
woman
was
saying.
She
stood
there
letting
the
words
fall
over
her,
swaying
the
top
part
of
her
body
slowly
backwards
and
forwards,
looking
at
the
flowers.
Then
she
suggested
that
they
should
find
a
seat
and
have
their
tea.
The
snail
had
now
considered
every
possible
method
of
reaching
his
goal
without
going
round
the
dead
leaf
or
climbing
over
it.
Let
alone
the
effort
needed
for
climbing
a
leaf,
he
was
doubtful
whether
the
thin
texture
which
vibrated
with
such
an
alarming
crackle
when
touched
even
by
the
tip
of
his
horns
would
bear
his
weight;
and
this
determined
him
finally
to
creep
beneath
it,
for
there
was
a
point
where
the
leaf
curved
high
enough
from
the
ground
to
admit
him.
He
had
just
inserted
his
head
in
the
opening
and
was
taking
stock
of
the
high
brown
roof
and
was
getting
used
to
the
cool
brown
light
when
two
other
people
came
past
outside
on
the
turf.
This
time
they
were
both
young,
a
young
man
and
a
young
woman.
They
were
both
in
the
prime
of
youth,
or
even
in
that
season
which
precedes
the
prime
of
youth,
the
season
before
the
smooth
pink
folds
of
the
flower
have
burst
their
gummy
case,
when
the
wings
of
the
butterfly,
though
fully
grown,
are
motionless
in
the
sun.
"Lucky
it
isn't
Friday,"
he
observed.
"Why?
D'you
believe
in
luck?"
"They
make
you
pay
sixpence
on
Friday."
"What's
sixpence
anyway?
Isn't
it
worth
sixpence?"
"What's
'it'—what
do
you
mean
by
'it'?"
"O,
anything—I
mean—you
know
what
I
mean."
Long
pauses
came
between
each
of
these
remarks;
they
were
uttered
in
toneless
and
monotonous
voices.
The
couple
stood
still
on
the
edge
of
the
flower
bed,
and
together
pressed
the
end
of
her
parasol
deep
down
into
the
soft
earth.
The
action
and
the
fact
that
his
hand
rested
on
the
top
of
hers
expressed
their
feelings
in
a
strange
way,
as
these
short
insignificant
words
also
expressed
something,
words
with
short
wings
for
their
heavy
body
of
meaning,
inadequate
to
carry
them
far
and
thus
alighting
awkwardly
upon
the
very
common
objects
that
surrounded
them,
and
were
to
their
inexperienced
touch
so
massive;
but
who
knows
(so
they
thought
as
they
pressed
the
parasol
into
the
earth)
what
precipices
aren't
concealed
in
them,
or
what
slopes
of
ice
don't
shine
in
the
sun
on
the
other
side?
Who
knows?
Who
has
ever
seen
this
before?
Even
when
she
wondered
what
sort
of
tea
they
gave
you
at
Kew,
he
felt
that
something
loomed
up
behind
her
words,
and
stood
vast
and
solid
behind
them;
and
the
mist
very
slowly
rose
and
uncovered—O,
Heavens,
what
were
those
shapes?—little
white
tables,
and
waitresses
who
looked
first
at
her
and
then
at
him;
and
there
was
a
bill
that
he
would
pay
with
a
real
two
shilling
piece,
and
it
was
real,
all
real,
he
assured
himself,
fingering
the
coin
in
his
pocket,
real
to
everyone
except
to
him
and
to
her;
even
to
him
it
began
to
seem
real;
and
then—but
it
was
too
exciting
to
stand
and
think
any
longer,
and
he
pulled
the
parasol
out
of
the
earth
with
a
jerk
and
was
impatient
to
find
the
place
where
one
had
tea
with
other
people,
like
other
people.
"Come
along,
Trissie;
it's
time
we
had
our
tea."
"Wherever
does
one
have
one's
tea?"
she
asked
with
the
oddest
thrill
of
excitement
in
her
voice,
looking
vaguely
round
and
letting
herself
be
drawn
on
down
the
grass
path,
trailing
her
parasol,
turning
her
head
this
way
and
that
way,
forgetting
her
tea,
wishing
to
go
down
there
and
then
down
there,
remembering
orchids
and
cranes
among
wild
flowers,
a
Chinese
pagoda
and
a
crimson
crested
bird;
but
he
bore
her
on.
Thus
one
couple
after
another
with
much
the
same
irregular
and
aimless
movement
passed
the
flower-bed
and
were
enveloped
in
layer
after
layer
of
green
blue
vapour,
in
which
at
first
their
bodies
had
substance
and
a
dash
of
colour,
but
later
both
substance
and
colour
dissolved
in
the
green-blue
atmosphere.
How
hot
it
was!
So
hot
that
even
the
thrush
chose
to
hop,
like
a
mechanical
bird,
in
the
shadow
of
the
flowers,
with
long
pauses
between
one
movement
and
the
next;
instead
of
rambling
vaguely
the
white
butterflies
danced
one
above
another,
making
with
their
white
shifting
flakes
the
outline
of
a
shattered
marble
column
above
the
tallest
flowers;
the
glass
roofs
of
the
palm
house
shone
as
if
a
whole
market
full
of
shiny
green
umbrellas
had
opened
in
the
sun;
and
in
the
drone
of
the
aeroplane
the
voice
of
the
summer
sky
murmured
its
fierce
soul.
Yellow
and
black,
pink
and
snow
white,
shapes
of
all
these
colours,
men,
women,
and
children
were
spotted
for
a
second
upon
the
horizon,
and
then,
seeing
the
breadth
of
yellow
that
lay
upon
the
grass,
they
wavered
and
sought
shade
beneath
the
trees,
dissolving
like
drops
of
water
in
the
yellow
and
green
atmosphere,
staining
it
faintly
with
red
and
blue.
It
seemed
as
if
all
gross
and
heavy
bodies
had
sunk
down
in
the
heat
motionless
and
lay
huddled
upon
the
ground,
but
their
voices
went
wavering
from
them
as
if
they
were
flames
lolling
from
the
thick
waxen
bodies
of
candles.
Voices.
Yes,
voices.
Wordless
voices,
breaking
the
silence
suddenly
with
such
depth
of
contentment,
such
passion
of
desire,
or,
in
the
voices
of
children,
such
freshness
of
surprise;
breaking
the
silence?
But
there
was
no
silence;
all
the
time
the
motor
omnibuses
were
turning
their
wheels
and
changing
their
gear;
like
a
vast
nest
of
Chinese
boxes
all
of
wrought
steel
turning
ceaselessly
one
within
another
the
city
murmured;
on
the
top
of
which
the
voices
cried
aloud
and
the
petals
of
myriads
of
flowers
flashed
their
colours
into
the
air.

This
is
how
it
all
came
about.
Six
or
seven
of
us
were
sitting
one
day
after
tea.
Some
were
gazing
across
the
street
into
the
windows
of
a
milliner's
shop
where
the
light
still
shone
brightly
upon
scarlet
feathers
and
golden
slippers.
Others
were
idly
occupied
in
building
little
towers
of
sugar
upon
the
edge
of
the
tea
tray.
After
a
time,
so
far
as
I
can
remember,
we
drew
round
the
fire
and
began
as
usual
to
praise
men—how
strong,
how
noble,
how
brilliant,
how
courageous,
how
beautiful
they
were—how
we
envied
those
who
by
hook
or
by
crook
managed
to
get
attached
to
one
for
life—when
Poll,
who
had
said
nothing,
burst
into
tears.
Poll,
I
must
tell
you,
has
always
been
queer.
For
one
thing
her
father
was
a
strange
man.
He
left
her
a
fortune
in
his
will,
but
on
condition
that
she
read
all
the
books
in
the
London
Library.
We
comforted
her
as
best
we
could;
but
we
knew
in
our
hearts
how
vain
it
was.
For
though
we
like
her,
Poll
is
no
beauty;
leaves
her
shoe
laces
untied;
and
must
have
been
thinking,
while
we
praised
men,
that
not
one
of
them
would
ever
wish
to
marry
her.
At
last
she
dried
her
tears.
For
some
time
we
could
make
nothing
of
what
she
said.
Strange
enough
it
was
in
all
conscience.
She
told
us
that,
as
we
knew,
she
spent
most
of
her
time
in
the
London
Library,
reading.
She
had
begun,
she
said,
with
English
literature
on
the
top
floor;
and
was
steadily
working
her
way
down
to
the
Times
on
the
bottom.
And
now
half,
or
perhaps
only
a
quarter,
way
through
a
terrible
thing
had
happened.
She
could
read
no
more.
Books
were
not
what
we
thought
them.
"Books,"
she
cried,
rising
to
her
feet
and
speaking
with
an
intensity
of
desolation
which
I
shall
never
forget,
"are
for
the
most
part
unutterably
bad!"
Of
course
we
cried
out
that
Shakespeare
wrote
books,
and
Milton
and
Shelley.
"Oh,
yes,"
she
interrupted
us.
"You've
been
well
taught,
I
can
see.
But
you
are
not
members
of
the
London
Library."
Here
her
sobs
broke
forth
anew.
At
length,
recovering
a
little,
she
opened
one
of
the
pile
of
books
which
she
always
carried
about
with
her—"From
a
Window"
or
"In
a
Garden,"
or
some
such
name
as
that
it
was
called,
and
it
was
written
by
a
man
called
Benton
or
Henson,
or
something
of
that
kind.
She
read
the
first
few
pages.
We
listened
in
silence.
"But
that's
not
a
book,"
someone
said.
So
she
chose
another.
This
time
it
was
a
history,
but
I
have
forgotten
the
writer's
name.
Our
trepidation
increased
as
she
went
on.
Not
a
word
of
it
seemed
to
be
true,
and
the
style
in
which
it
was
written
was
execrable.
"Poetry!
Poetry!"
we
cried,
impatiently.
"Read
us
poetry!"
I
cannot
describe
the
desolation
which
fell
upon
us
as
she
opened
a
little
volume
and
mouthed
out
the
verbose,
sentimental
foolery
which
it
contained.
"It
must
have
been
written
by
a
woman,"
one
of
us
urged.
But
no.
She
told
us
that
it
was
written
by
a
young
man,
one
of
the
most
famous
poets
of
the
day.
I
leave
you
to
imagine
what
the
shock
of
the
discovery
was.
Though
we
all
cried
and
begged
her
to
read
no
more,
she
persisted
and
read
us
extracts
from
the
Lives
of
the
Lord
Chancellors.
When
she
had
finished,
Jane,
the
eldest
and
wisest
of
us,
rose
to
her
feet
and
said
that
she
for
one
was
not
convinced.
"Why,"
she
asked,
"if
men
write
such
rubbish
as
this,
should
our
mothers
have
wasted
their
youth
in
bringing
them
into
the
world?"
We
were
all
silent;
and,
in
the
silence,
poor
Poll
could
be
heard
sobbing
out,
"Why,
why
did
my
father
teach
me
to
read?"
Clorinda
was
the
first
to
come
to
her
senses.
"It's
all
our
fault,"
she
said.
"Every
one
of
us
knows
how
to
read.
But
no
one,
save
Poll,
has
ever
taken
the
trouble
to
do
it.
I,
for
one,
have
taken
it
for
granted
that
it
was
a
woman's
duty
to
spend
her
youth
in
bearing
children.
I
venerated
my
mother
for
bearing
ten;
still
more
my
grandmother
for
bearing
fifteen;
it
was,
I
confess,
my
own
ambition
to
bear
twenty.
We
have
gone
on
all
these
ages
supposing
that
men
were
equally
industrious,
and
that
their
works
were
of
equal
merit.
While
we
have
borne
the
children,
they,
we
supposed,
have
borne
the
books
and
the
pictures.
We
have
populated
the
world.
They
have
civilized
it.
But
now
that
we
can
read,
what
prevents
us
from
judging
the
results?
Before
we
bring
another
child
into
the
world
we
must
swear
that
we
will
find
out
what
the
world
is
like."
So
we
made
ourselves
into
a
society
for
asking
questions.
One
of
us
was
to
visit
a
man-of-war;
another
was
to
hide
herself
in
a
scholar's
study;
another
was
to
attend
a
meeting
of
business
men;
while
all
were
to
read
books,
look
at
pictures,
go
to
concerts,
keep
our
eyes
open
in
the
streets,
and
ask
questions
perpetually.
We
were
very
young.
You
can
judge
of
our
simplicity
when
I
tell
you
that
before
parting
that
night
we
agreed
that
the
objects
of
life
were
to
produce
good
people
and
good
books.
Our
questions
were
to
be
directed
to
finding
out
how
far
these
objects
were
now
attained
by
men.
We
vowed
solemnly
that
we
would
not
bear
a
single
child
until
we
were
satisfied.
Off
we
went
then,
some
to
the
British
Museum;
others
to
the
King's
Navy;
some
to
Oxford;
others
to
Cambridge;
we
visited
the
Royal
Academy
and
the
Tate;
heard
modern
music
in
concert
rooms,
went
to
the
Law
Courts,
and
saw
new
plays.
No
one
dined
out
without
asking
her
partner
certain
questions
and
carefully
noting
his
replies.
At
intervals
we
met
together
and
compared
our
observations.
Oh,
those
were
merry
meetings!
Never
have
I
laughed
so
much
as
I
did
when
Rose
read
her
notes
upon
"Honour"
and
described
how
she
had
dressed
herself
as
an
Æthiopian
Prince
and
gone
aboard
one
of
His
Majesty's
ships.
Discovering
the
hoax,
the
Captain
visited
her
(now
disguised
as
a
private
gentleman)
and
demanded
that
honour
should
be
satisfied.
"But
how?"
she
asked.
"How?"
he
bellowed.
"With
the
cane
of
course!"
Seeing
that
he
was
beside
himself
with
rage
and
expecting
that
her
last
moment
had
come,
she
bent
over
and
received,
to
her
amazement,
six
light
taps
upon
the
behind.
"The
honour
of
the
British
Navy
is
avenged!"
he
cried,
and,
raising
herself,
she
saw
him
with
the
sweat
pouring
down
his
face
holding
out
a
trembling
right
hand.
"Away!"
she
exclaimed,
striking
an
attitude
and
imitating
the
ferocity
of
his
own
expression,
"My
honour
has
still
to
be
satisfied!"
"Spoken
like
a
gentleman!"
he
returned,
and
fell
into
profound
thought.
"If
six
strokes
avenge
the
honour
of
the
King's
Navy,"
he
mused,
"how
many
avenge
the
honour
of
a
private
gentleman?"
He
said
he
would
prefer
to
lay
the
case
before
his
brother
officers.
She
replied
haughtily
that
she
could
not
wait.
He
praised
her
sensibility.
"Let
me
see,"
he
cried
suddenly,
"did
your
father
keep
a
carriage?"
"No,"
she
said.
"Or
a
riding
horse!"
"We
had
a
donkey,"
she
bethought
her,
"which
drew
the
mowing
machine."
At
this
his
face
lighted.
"My
mother's
name——"
she
added.
"For
God's
sake,
man,
don't
mention
your
mother's
name!"
he
shrieked,
trembling
like
an
aspen
and
flushing
to
the
roots
of
his
hair,
and
it
was
ten
minutes
at
least
before
she
could
induce
him
to
proceed.
At
length
he
decreed
that
if
she
gave
him
four
strokes
and
a
half
in
the
small
of
the
back
at
a
spot
indicated
by
himself
(the
half
conceded,
he
said,
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
her
great
grandmother's
uncle
was
killed
at
Trafalgar)
it
was
his
opinion
that
her
honour
would
be
as
good
as
new.
This
was
done;
they
retired
to
a
restaurant;
drank
two
bottles
of
wine
for
which
he
insisted
upon
paying;
and
parted
with
protestations
of
eternal
friendship.
Then
we
had
Fanny's
account
of
her
visit
to
the
Law
Courts.
At
her
first
visit
she
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
Judges
were
either
made
of
wood
or
were
impersonated
by
large
animals
resembling
man
who
had
been
trained
to
move
with
extreme
dignity,
mumble
and
nod
their
heads.
To
test
her
theory
she
had
liberated
a
handkerchief
of
bluebottles
at
the
critical
moment
of
a
trial,
but
was
unable
to
judge
whether
the
creatures
gave
signs
of
humanity
for
the
buzzing
of
the
flies
induced
so
sound
a
sleep
that
she
only
woke
in
time
to
see
the
prisoners
led
into
the
cells
below.
But
from
the
evidence
she
brought
we
voted
that
it
is
unfair
to
suppose
that
the
Judges
are
men.
Helen
went
to
the
Royal
Academy,
but
when
asked
to
deliver
her
report
upon
the
pictures
she
began
to
recite
from
a
pale
blue
volume,
"O!
for
the
touch
of
a
vanished
hand
and
the
sound
of
a
voice
that
is
still.
Home
is
the
hunter,
home
from
the
hill.
He
gave
his
bridle
reins
a
shake.
Love
is
sweet,
love
is
brief.
Spring,
the
fair
spring,
is
the
year's
pleasant
King.
O!
to
be
in
England
now
that
April's
there.
Men
must
work
and
women
must
weep.
The
path
of
duty
is
the
way
to
glory—"
We
could
listen
to
no
more
of
this
gibberish.
"We
want
no
more
poetry!"
we
cried.
"Daughters
of
England!"
she
began,
but
here
we
pulled
her
down,
a
vase
of
water
getting
spilt
over
her
in
the
scuffle.
"Thank
God!"
she
exclaimed,
shaking
herself
like
a
dog.
"Now
I'll
roll
on
the
carpet
and
see
if
I
can't
brush
off
what
remains
of
the
Union
Jack.
Then
perhaps—"
here
she
rolled
energetically.
Getting
up
she
began
to
explain
to
us
what
modern
pictures
are
like
when
Castalia
stopped
her.
"What
is
the
average
size
of
a
picture?"
she
asked.
"Perhaps
two
feet
by
two
and
a
half,"
she
said.
Castalia
made
notes
while
Helen
spoke,
and
when
she
had
done,
and
we
were
trying
not
to
meet
each
other's
eyes,
rose
and
said,
"At
your
wish
I
spent
last
week
at
Oxbridge,
disguised
as
a
charwoman.
I
thus
had
access
to
the
rooms
of
several
Professors
and
will
now
attempt
to
give
you
some
idea—only,"
she
broke
off,
"I
can't
think
how
to
do
it.
It's
all
so
queer.
These
Professors,"
she
went
on,
"live
in
large
houses
built
round
grass
plots
each
in
a
kind
of
cell
by
himself.
Yet
they
have
every
convenience
and
comfort.
You
have
only
to
press
a
button
or
light
a
little
lamp.
Their
papers
are
beautifully
filed.
Books
abound.
There
are
no
children
or
animals,
save
half
a
dozen
stray
cats
and
one
aged
bullfinch—a
cock.
I
remember,"
she
broke
off,
"an
Aunt
of
mine
who
lived
at
Dulwich
and
kept
cactuses.
You
reached
the
conservatory
through
the
double
drawing-room,
and
there,
on
the
hot
pipes,
were
dozens
of
them,
ugly,
squat,
bristly
little
plants
each
in
a
separate
pot.
Once
in
a
hundred
years
the
Aloe
flowered,
so
my
Aunt
said.
But
she
died
before
that
happened—"
We
told
her
to
keep
to
the
point.
"Well,"
she
resumed,
"when
Professor
Hobkin
was
out,
I
examined
his
life
work,
an
edition
of
Sappho.
It's
a
queer
looking
book,
six
or
seven
inches
thick,
not
all
by
Sappho.
Oh,
no.
Most
of
it
is
a
defence
of
Sappho's
chastity,
which
some
German
had
denied,
and
I
can
assure
you
the
passion
with
which
these
two
gentlemen
argued,
the
learning
they
displayed,
the
prodigious
ingenuity
with
which
they
disputed
the
use
of
some
implement
which
looked
to
me
for
all
the
world
like
a
hairpin
astounded
me;
especially
when
the
door
opened
and
Professor
Hobkin
himself
appeared.
A
very
nice,
mild,
old
gentleman,
but
what
could
he
know
about
chastity?"
We
misunderstood
her.
"No,
no,"
she
protested,
"he's
the
soul
of
honour
I'm
sure—not
that
he
resembles
Rose's
sea
captain
in
the
least.
I
was
thinking
rather
of
my
Aunt's
cactuses.
What
could
they
know
about
chastity?"
Again
we
told
her
not
to
wander
from
the
point,—did
the
Oxbridge
professors
help
to
produce
good
people
and
good
books?—the
objects
of
life.
"There!"
she
exclaimed.
"It
never
struck
me
to
ask.
It
never
occurred
to
me
that
they
could
possibly
produce
anything."
"I
believe,"
said
Sue,
"that
you
made
some
mistake.
Probably
Professor
Hobkin
was
a
gynæcologist.
A
scholar
is
a
very
different
sort
of
man.
A
scholar
is
overflowing
with
humour
and
invention—perhaps
addicted
to
wine,
but
what
of
that?—a
delightful
companion,
generous,
subtle,
imaginative—as
stands
to
reason.
For
he
spends
his
life
in
company
with
the
finest
human
beings
that
have
ever
existed."
"Hum,"
said
Castalia.
"Perhaps
I'd
better
go
back
and
try
again."
Some
three
months
later
it
happened
that
I
was
sitting
alone
when
Castalia
entered.
I
don't
know
what
it
was
in
the
look
of
her
that
so
moved
me;
but
I
could
not
restrain
myself,
and,
dashing
across
the
room,
I
clasped
her
in
my
arms.
Not
only
was
she
very
beautiful;
she
seemed
also
in
the
highest
spirits.
"How
happy
you
look!"
I
exclaimed,
as
she
sat
down.
"I've
been
at
Oxbridge,"
she
said.
"Asking
questions?"
"Answering
them,"
she
replied.
"You
have
not
broken
our
vow?"
I
said
anxiously,
noticing
something
about
her
figure.
"Oh,
the
vow,"
she
said
casually.
"I'm
going
to
have
a
baby,
if
that's
what
you
mean.
You
can't
imagine,"
she
burst
out,
"how
exciting,
how
beautiful,
how
satisfying—"
"What
is?"
I
asked.
"To—to—answer
questions,"
she
replied
in
some
confusion.
Whereupon
she
told
me
the
whole
of
her
story.
But
in
the
middle
of
an
account
which
interested
and
excited
me
more
than
anything
I
had
ever
heard,
she
gave
the
strangest
cry,
half
whoop,
half
holloa—
"Chastity!
Chastity!
Where's
my
chastity!"
she
cried.
"Help
Ho!
The
scent
bottle!"
There
was
nothing
in
the
room
but
a
cruet
containing
mustard,
which
I
was
about
to
administer
when
she
recovered
her
composure.
"You
should
have
thought
of
that
three
months
ago,"
I
said
severely.
"True,"
she
replied.
"There's
not
much
good
in
thinking
of
it
now.
It
was
unfortunate,
by
the
way,
that
my
mother
had
me
called
Castalia."
"Oh,
Castalia,
your
mother—"
I
was
beginning
when
she
reached
for
the
mustard
pot.
"No,
no,
no,"
she
said,
shaking
her
head.
"If
you'd
been
a
chaste
woman
yourself
you
would
have
screamed
at
the
sight
of
me—instead
of
which
you
rushed
across
the
room
and
took
me
in
your
arms.
No,
Cassandra.
We
are
neither
of
us
chaste."
So
we
went
on
talking.
Meanwhile
the
room
was
filling
up,
for
it
was
the
day
appointed
to
discuss
the
results
of
our
observations.
Everyone,
I
thought,
felt
as
I
did
about
Castalia.
They
kissed
her
and
said
how
glad
they
were
to
see
her
again.
At
length,
when
we
were
all
assembled,
Jane
rose
and
said
that
it
was
time
to
begin.
She
began
by
saying
that
we
had
now
asked
questions
for
over
five
years,
and
that
though
the
results
were
bound
to
be
inconclusive—here
Castalia
nudged
me
and
whispered
that
she
was
not
so
sure
about
that.
Then
she
got
up,
and,
interrupting
Jane
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence,
said:
"Before
you
say
any
more,
I
want
to
know—am
I
to
stay
in
the
room?
Because,"
she
added,
"I
have
to
confess
that
I
am
an
impure
woman."
Everyone
looked
at
her
in
astonishment.
"You
are
going
to
have
a
baby?"
asked
Jane.
She
nodded
her
head.
It
was
extraordinary
to
see
the
different
expressions
on
their
faces.
A
sort
of
hum
went
through
the
room,
in
which
I
could
catch
the
words
"impure,"
"baby,"
"Castalia,"
and
so
on.
Jane,
who
was
herself
considerably
moved,
put
it
to
us:
"Shall
she
go?
Is
she
impure?"
Such
a
roar
filled
the
room
as
might
have
been
heard
in
the
street
outside.
"No!
No!
No!
Let
her
stay!
Impure?
Fiddlesticks!"
Yet
I
fancied
that
some
of
the
youngest,
girls
of
nineteen
or
twenty,
held
back
as
if
overcome
with
shyness.
Then
we
all
came
about
her
and
began
asking
questions,
and
at
last
I
saw
one
of
the
youngest,
who
had
kept
in
the
background,
approach
shyly
and
say
to
her:
"What
is
chastity
then?
I
mean
is
it
good,
or
is
it
bad,
or
is
it
nothing
at
all?"
She
replied
so
low
that
I
could
not
catch
what
she
said.
"You
know
I
was
shocked,"
said
another,
"for
at
least
ten
minutes."
"In
my
opinion,"
said
Poll,
who
was
growing
crusty
from
always
reading
in
the
London
Library,
"chastity
is
nothing
but
ignorance—a
most
discreditable
state
of
mind.
We
should
admit
only
the
unchaste
to
our
society.
I
vote
that
Castalia
shall
be
our
President."
This
was
violently
disputed.
"It
is
as
unfair
to
brand
women
with
chastity
as
with
unchastity,"
said
Poll.
"Some
of
us
haven't
the
opportunity
either.
Moreover,
I
don't
believe
Cassy
herself
maintains
that
she
acted
as
she
did
from
a
pure
love
of
knowledge."
"He
is
only
twenty-one
and
divinely
beautiful,"
said
Cassy,
with
a
ravishing
gesture.
"I
move,"
said
Helen,
"that
no
one
be
allowed
to
talk
of
chastity
or
unchastity
save
those
who
are
in
love."
"Oh,
bother,"
said
Judith,
who
had
been
enquiring
into
scientific
matters,
"I'm
not
in
love
and
I'm
longing
to
explain
my
measures
for
dispensing
with
prostitutes
and
fertilizing
virgins
by
Act
of
Parliament."
She
went
on
to
tell
us
of
an
invention
of
hers
to
be
erected
at
Tube
stations
and
other
public
resorts,
which,
upon
payment
of
a
small
fee,
would
safeguard
the
nation's
health,
accommodate
its
sons,
and
relieve
its
daughters.
Then
she
had
contrived
a
method
of
preserving
in
sealed
tubes
the
germs
of
future
Lord
Chancellors
"or
poets
or
painters
or
musicians,"
she
went
on,
"supposing,
that
is
to
say,
that
these
breeds
are
not
extinct,
and
that
women
still
wish
to
bear
children——"
"Of
course
we
wish
to
bear
children!"
cried
Castalia,
impatiently.
Jane
rapped
the
table.
"That
is
the
very
point
we
are
met
to
consider,"
she
said.
"For
five
years
we
have
been
trying
to
find
out
whether
we
are
justified
in
continuing
the
human
race.
Castalia
has
anticipated
our
decision.
But
it
remains
for
the
rest
of
us
to
make
up
our
minds."
Here
one
after
another
of
our
messengers
rose
and
delivered
their
reports.
The
marvels
of
civilisation
far
exceeded
our
expectations,
and,
as
we
learnt
for
the
first
time
how
man
flies
in
the
air,
talks
across
space,
penetrates
to
the
heart
of
an
atom,
and
embraces
the
universe
in
his
speculations,
a
murmur
of
admiration
burst
from
our
lips.
"We
are
proud,"
we
cried,
"that
our
mothers
sacrificed
their
youth
in
such
a
cause
as
this!"
Castalia,
who
had
been
listening
intently,
looked
prouder
than
all
the
rest.
Then
Jane
reminded
us
that
we
had
still
much
to
learn,
and
Castalia
begged
us
to
make
haste.
On
we
went
through
a
vast
tangle
of
statistics.
We
learnt
that
England
has
a
population
of
so
many
millions,
and
that
such
and
such
a
proportion
of
them
is
constantly
hungry
and
in
prison;
that
the
average
size
of
a
working
man's
family
is
such,
and
that
so
great
a
percentage
of
women
die
from
maladies
incident
to
childbirth.
Reports
were
read
of
visits
to
factories,
shops,
slums,
and
dockyards.
Descriptions
were
given
of
the
Stock
Exchange,
of
a
gigantic
house
of
business
in
the
City,
and
of
a
Government
Office.
The
British
Colonies
were
now
discussed,
and
some
account
was
given
of
our
rule
in
India,
Africa
and
Ireland.
I
was
sitting
by
Castalia
and
I
noticed
her
uneasiness.
"We
shall
never
come
to
any
conclusion
at
all
at
this
rate,"
she
said.
"As
it
appears
that
civilisation
is
so
much
more
complex
than
we
had
any
notion,
would
it
not
be
better
to
confine
ourselves
to
our
original
enquiry?
We
agreed
that
it
was
the
object
of
life
to
produce
good
people
and
good
books.
All
this
time
we
have
been
talking
of
aeroplanes,
factories,
and
money.
Let
us
talk
about
men
themselves
and
their
arts,
for
that
is
the
heart
of
the
matter."
So
the
diners
out
stepped
forward
with
long
slips
of
paper
containing
answers
to
their
questions.
These
had
been
framed
after
much
consideration.
A
good
man,
we
had
agreed,
must
at
any
rate
be
honest,
passionate,
and
unworldly.
But
whether
or
not
a
particular
man
possessed
those
qualities
could
only
be
discovered
by
asking
questions,
often
beginning
at
a
remote
distance
from
the
centre.
Is
Kensington
a
nice
place
to
live
in?
Where
is
your
son
being
educated—and
your
daughter?
Now
please
tell
me,
what
do
you
pay
for
your
cigars?
By
the
way,
is
Sir
Joseph
a
baronet
or
only
a
knight?
Often
it
seemed
that
we
learnt
more
from
trivial
questions
of
this
kind
than
from
more
direct
ones.
"I
accepted
my
peerage,"
said
Lord
Bunkum,
"because
my
wife
wished
it."
I
forget
how
many
titles
were
accepted
for
the
same
reason.
"Working
fifteen
hours
out
of
the
twenty-four,
as
I
do——"
ten
thousand
professional
men
began.
"No,
no,
of
course
you
can
neither
read
nor
write.
But
why
do
you
work
so
hard?"
"My
dear
lady,
with
a
growing
family——"
"But
why
does
your
family
grow?"
Their
wives
wished
that
too,
or
perhaps
it
was
the
British
Empire.
But
more
significant
than
the
answers
were
the
refusals
to
answer.
Very
few
would
reply
at
all
to
questions
about
morality
and
religion,
and
such
answers
as
were
given
were
not
serious.
Questions
as
to
the
value
of
money
and
power
were
almost
invariably
brushed
aside,
or
pressed
at
extreme
risk
to
the
asker.
"I'm
sure,"
said
Jill,
"that
if
Sir
Harley
Tightboots
hadn't
been
carving
the
mutton
when
I
asked
him
about
the
capitalist
system
he
would
have
cut
my
throat.
The
only
reason
why
we
escaped
with
our
lives
over
and
over
again
is
that
men
are
at
once
so
hungry
and
so
chivalrous.
They
despise
us
too
much
to
mind
what
we
say."
"Of
course
they
despise
us,"
said
Eleanor.
"At
the
same
time
how
do
you
account
for
this—I
made
enquiries
among
the
artists.
Now,
no
woman
has
ever
been
an
artist,
has
she,
Poll?"
"Jane-Austen-Charlotte-Brontë-George-Eliot,"
cried
Poll,
like
a
man
crying
muffins
in
a
back
street.
"Damn
the
woman!"
someone
exclaimed.
"What
a
bore
she
is!"
"Since
Sappho
there
has
been
no
female
of
first
rate——"
Eleanor
began,
quoting
from
a
weekly
newspaper.
"It's
now
well
known
that
Sappho
was
the
somewhat
lewd
invention
of
Professor
Hobkin,"
Ruth
interrupted.
"Anyhow,
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
any
woman
ever
has
been
able
to
write
or
ever
will
be
able
to
write,"
Eleanor
continued.
"And
yet,
whenever
I
go
among
authors
they
never
cease
to
talk
to
me
about
their
books.
Masterly!
I
say,
or
Shakespeare
himself!
(for
one
must
say
something)
and
I
assure
you,
they
believe
me."
"That
proves
nothing,"
said
Jane.
"They
all
do
it.
Only,"
she
sighed,
"it
doesn't
seem
to
help
us
much.
Perhaps
we
had
better
examine
modern
literature
next.
Liz,
it's
your
turn."
Elizabeth
rose
and
said
that
in
order
to
prosecute
her
enquiry
she
had
dressed
as
a
man
and
been
taken
for
a
reviewer.
"I
have
read
new
books
pretty
steadily
for
the
past
five
years,"
said
she.
"Mr.
Wells
is
the
most
popular
living
writer;
then
comes
Mr.
Arnold
Bennett;
then
Mr.
Compton
Mackenzie;
Mr.
McKenna
and
Mr.
Walpole
may
be
bracketed
together."
She
sat
down.
"But
you've
told
us
nothing!"
we
expostulated.
"Or
do
you
mean
that
these
gentlemen
have
greatly
surpassed
Jane-Elliot
and
that
English
fiction
is——where's
that
review
of
yours?
Oh,
yes,
'safe
in
their
hands.'"
"Safe,
quite
safe,"
she
said,
shifting
uneasily
from
foot
to
foot.
"And
I'm
sure
that
they
give
away
even
more
than
they
receive."
We
were
all
sure
of
that.
"But,"
we
pressed
her,
"do
they
write
good
books?"
"Good
books?"
she
said,
looking
at
the
ceiling.
"You
must
remember,"
she
began,
speaking
with
extreme
rapidity,
"that
fiction
is
the
mirror
of
life.
And
you
can't
deny
that
education
is
of
the
highest
importance,
and
that
it
would
be
extremely
annoying,
if
you
found
yourself
alone
at
Brighton
late
at
night,
not
to
know
which
was
the
best
boarding
house
to
stay
at,
and
suppose
it
was
a
dripping
Sunday
evening—wouldn't
it
be
nice
to
go
to
the
Movies?"
"But
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it?"
we
asked.
"Nothing—nothing—nothing
whatever,"
she
replied.
"Well,
tell
us
the
truth,"
we
bade
her.
"The
truth?
But
isn't
it
wonderful,"
she
broke
off—"Mr.
Chitter
has
written
a
weekly
article
for
the
past
thirty
years
upon
love
or
hot
buttered
toast
and
has
sent
all
his
sons
to
Eton——"
"The
truth!"
we
demanded.
"Oh,
the
truth,"
she
stammered,
"the
truth
has
nothing
to
do
with
literature,"
and
sitting
down
she
refused
to
say
another
word.
It
all
seemed
to
us
very
inconclusive.
"Ladies,
we
must
try
to
sum
up
the
results,"
Jane
was
beginning,
when
a
hum,
which
had
been
heard
for
some
time
through
the
open
window,
drowned
her
voice.
"War!
War!
War!
Declaration
of
War!"
men
were
shouting
in
the
street
below.
We
looked
at
each
other
in
horror.
"What
war?"
we
cried.
"What
war?"
We
remembered,
too
late,
that
we
had
never
thought
of
sending
anyone
to
the
House
of
Commons.
We
had
forgotten
all
about
it.
We
turned
to
Poll,
who
had
reached
the
history
shelves
in
the
London
Library,
and
asked
her
to
enlighten
us.
"Why,"
we
cried,
"do
men
go
to
war?"
"Sometimes
for
one
reason,
sometimes
for
another,"
she
replied
calmly.
"In
1760,
for
example——"
The
shouts
outside
drowned
her
words.
"Again
in
1797—in
1804—It
was
the
Austrians
in
1866—1870
was
the
Franco-Prussian—In
1900
on
the
other
hand——"
"But
it's
now
1914!"
we
cut
her
short.
"Ah,
I
don't
know
what
they're
going
to
war
for
now,"
she
admitted.
*
*
*
*
*
The
war
was
over
and
peace
was
in
process
of
being
signed,
when
I
once
more
found
myself
with
Castalia
in
the
room
where
our
meetings
used
to
be
held.
We
began
idly
turning
over
the
pages
of
our
old
minute
books.
"Queer,"
I
mused,
"to
see
what
we
were
thinking
five
years
ago."
"We
are
agreed,"
Castalia
quoted,
reading
over
my
shoulder,
"that
it
is
the
object
of
life
to
produce
good
people
and
good
books."
We
made
no
comment
upon
that.
"A
good
man
is
at
any
rate
honest,
passionate
and
unworldly."
"What
a
woman's
language!"
I
observed.
"Oh,
dear,"
cried
Castalia,
pushing
the
book
away
from
her,
"what
fools
we
were!
It
was
all
Poll's
father's
fault,"
she
went
on.
"I
believe
he
did
it
on
purpose—that
ridiculous
will,
I
mean,
forcing
Poll
to
read
all
the
books
in
the
London
Library.
If
we
hadn't
learnt
to
read,"
she
said
bitterly,
"we
might
still
have
been
bearing
children
in
ignorance
and
that
I
believe
was
the
happiest
life
after
all.
I
know
what
you're
going
to
say
about
war,"
she
checked
me,
"and
the
horror
of
bearing
children
to
see
them
killed,
but
our
mothers
did
it,
and
their
mothers,
and
their
mothers
before
them.
And
they
didn't
complain.
They
couldn't
read.
I've
done
my
best,"
she
sighed,
"to
prevent
my
little
girl
from
learning
to
read,
but
what's
the
use?
I
caught
Ann
only
yesterday
with
a
newspaper
in
her
hand
and
she
was
beginning
to
ask
me
if
it
was
'true.'
Next
she'll
ask
me
whether
Mr.
Lloyd
George
is
a
good
man,
then
whether
Mr.
Arnold
Bennett
is
a
good
novelist,
and
finally
whether
I
believe
in
God.
How
can
I
bring
my
daughter
up
to
believe
in
nothing?"
she
demanded.
"Surely
you
could
teach
her
to
believe
that
a
man's
intellect
is,
and
always
will
be,
fundamentally
superior
to
a
woman's?"
I
suggested.
She
brightened
at
this
and
began
to
turn
over
our
old
minutes
again.
"Yes,"
she
said,
"think
of
their
discoveries,
their
mathematics,
their
science,
their
philosophy,
their
scholarship——"
and
then
she
began
to
laugh,
"I
shall
never
forget
old
Hobkin
and
the
hairpin,"
she
said,
and
went
on
reading
and
laughing
and
I
thought
she
was
quite
happy,
when
suddenly
she
drew
the
book
from
her
and
burst
out,
"Oh,
Cassandra,
why
do
you
torment
me?
Don't
you
know
that
our
belief
in
man's
intellect
is
the
greatest
fallacy
of
them
all?"
"What?"
I
exclaimed.
"Ask
any
journalist,
schoolmaster,
politician
or
public
house
keeper
in
the
land
and
they
will
all
tell
you
that
men
are
much
cleverer
than
women."
"As
if
I
doubted
it,"
she
said
scornfully.
"How
could
they
help
it?
Haven't
we
bred
them
and
fed
and
kept
them
in
comfort
since
the
beginning
of
time
so
that
they
may
be
clever
even
if
they're
nothing
else?
It's
all
our
doing!"
she
cried.
"We
insisted
upon
having
intellect
and
now
we've
got
it.
And
it's
intellect,"
she
continued,
"that's
at
the
bottom
of
it.
What
could
be
more
charming
than
a
boy
before
he
has
begun
to
cultivate
his
intellect?
He
is
beautiful
to
look
at;
he
gives
himself
no
airs;
he
understands
the
meaning
of
art
and
literature
instinctively;
he
goes
about
enjoying
his
life
and
making
other
people
enjoy
theirs.
Then
they
teach
him
to
cultivate
his
intellect.
He
becomes
a
barrister,
a
civil
servant,
a
general,
an
author,
a
professor.
Every
day
he
goes
to
an
office.
Every
year
he
produces
a
book.
He
maintains
a
whole
family
by
the
products
of
his
brain—poor
devil!
Soon
he
cannot
come
into
a
room
without
making
us
all
feel
uncomfortable;
he
condescends
to
every
woman
he
meets,
and
dares
not
tell
the
truth
even
to
his
own
wife;
instead
of
rejoicing
our
eyes
we
have
to
shut
them
if
we
are
to
take
him
in
our
arms.
True,
they
console
themselves
with
stars
of
all
shapes,
ribbons
of
all
shades,
and
incomes
of
all
sizes—but
what
is
to
console
us?
That
we
shall
be
able
in
ten
years'
time
to
spend
a
week-end
at
Lahore?
Or
that
the
least
insect
in
Japan
has
a
name
twice
the
length
of
its
body?
Oh,
Cassandra,
for
Heaven's
sake
let
us
devise
a
method
by
which
men
may
bear
children!
It
is
our
only
chance.
For
unless
we
provide
them
with
some
innocent
occupation
we
shall
get
neither
good
people
nor
good
books;
we
shall
perish
beneath
the
fruits
of
their
unbridled
activity;
and
not
a
human
being
will
survive
to
know
that
there
once
was
Shakespeare!"
"It
is
too
late,"
I
replied.
"We
cannot
provide
even
for
the
children
that
we
have."
"And
then
you
ask
me
to
believe
in
intellect,"
she
said.
While
we
spoke,
men
were
crying
hoarsely
and
wearily
in
the
street,
and,
listening,
we
heard
that
the
Treaty
of
Peace
had
just
been
signed.
The
voices
died
away.
The
rain
was
falling
and
interfered
no
doubt
with
the
proper
explosion
of
the
fireworks.
"My
cook
will
have
bought
the
Evening
News,"
said
Castalia,
"and
Ann
will
be
spelling
it
out
over
her
tea.
I
must
go
home."
"It's
no
good—not
a
bit
of
good,"
I
said.
"Once
she
knows
how
to
read
there's
only
one
thing
you
can
teach
her
to
believe
in—and
that
is
herself."
"Well,
that
would
be
a
change,"
sighed
Castalia.
So
we
swept
up
the
papers
of
our
Society,
and,
though
Ann
was
playing
with
her
doll
very
happily,
we
solemnly
made
her
a
present
of
the
lot
and
told
her
we
had
chosen
her
to
be
President
of
the
Society
of
the
future—upon
which
she
burst
into
tears,
poor
little
girl.

Hand
in
hand
the
youthful
lovers
sauntered
along
the
esplanade.
It
was
a
night
in
midsummer;
a
wispy
moon
had
set,
and
the
stars
glittered.
The
dark
mass
of
the
sea,
at
flood,
lay
tranquil,
slothfully
lapping
the
shingle.
"Come
on,
let's
make
for
the
usual,"
said
the
boy.
But
on
nearing
their
favourite
seat
they
found
it
occupied.
In
the
velvety
shade
of
the
overhanging
sea-wall,
the
outlines
of
two
figures
were
visible.
"Oh,
blast!"
said
the
lad.
"That's
torn
it.
What
now,
Baby?"
"Why,
let's
stop
here,
Pincher,
right
close
up,
till
we
frighten
'em
off."
And
very
soon
loud,
smacking
kisses,
amatory
pinches
and
ticklings,
and
skittish
squeals
of
pleasure
did
their
work.
Silently
the
intruders
rose
and
moved
away.
But
the
boy
stood
gaping
after
them,
open-mouthed.
"Well,
I'm
DAMNED!
If
it
wasn't
just
two
hanged
women!"
Retreating
before
a
salvo
of
derisive
laughter,
the
elder
of
the
girls
said:
"We'll
go
out
on
the
break-water."
She
was
tall
and
thin,
and
walked
with
a
long
stride.
Her
companion,
shorter
than
she
by
a
bobbed
head
of
straight
flaxen
hair,
was
hard
put
to
it
to
keep
pace.
As
she
pegged
along
she
said
doubtfully,
as
if
in
self-excuse:
"Though
I
really
ought
to
go
home.
It's
getting
late.
Mother
will
be
angry."
They
walked
with
finger-tips
lightly
in
contact;
and
at
her
words
she
felt
what
was
like
an
attempt
to
get
free,
on
the
part
of
the
fingers
crooked
in
hers.
But
she
was
prepared
for
this,
and
held
fast,
gradually
working
her
own
up
till
she
had
a
good
half
of
the
other
hand
in
her
grip.
For
a
moment
neither
spoke.
Then,
in
a
low,
muffled
voice,
came
the
question:
"Was
she
angry
last
night,
too?"
The
little
fair
girl's
reply
had
an
unlooked-for
vehemence.
"You
know
she
wasn't!"
And,
mildly
despairing:
"But
you
never
WILL
understand.
Oh,
what's
the
good
of
. . .
of
anything!"
And
on
sitting
down
she
let
the
prisoned
hand
go,
even
putting
it
from
her
with
a
kind
of
push.
There
it
lay,
palm
upwards,
the
fingers
still
curved
from
her
hold,
looking
like
a
thing
with
a
separate
life
of
its
own;
but
a
life
that
was
ebbing.
On
this
remote
seat,
with
their
backs
turned
on
lovers,
lights,
the
town,
the
two
girls
sat
and
gazed
wordlessly
at
the
dark
sea,
over
which
great
Jupiter
was
flinging
a
thin
gold
line.
There
was
no
sound
but
the
lapping,
sucking,
sighing,
of
the
ripples
at
the
edge
of
the
breakwater,
and
the
occasional
screech
of
an
owl
in
the
tall
trees
on
the
hillside.
But
after
a
time,
having
stolen
more
than
one
side-glance
at
her
companion,
the
younger
seemed
to
take
heart
of
grace.
With
a
childish
toss
of
the
head
that
set
her
loose
hair
swaying,
she
said,
in
a
tone
of
meaning
emphasis:
"I
like
Fred."
The
only
answer
was
a
faint,
contemptuous
shrug.
"I
tell
you
I
LIKE
him!"
"Fred?
Rats!"
"No
it
isn't
. . .
that's
just
where
you're
wrong,
Betty.
But
you
think
you're
so
wise.
Always."
"I
know
what
I
know."
"Or
imagine
you
do!
But
it
doesn't
matter.
Nothing
you
can
say
makes
any
difference.
I
like
him,
and
always
shall.
In
heaps
of
ways.
He's
so
big
and
strong,
for
one
thing:
it
gives
you
such
a
safe
sort
of
feeling
to
be
with
him
. . .
as
if
nothing
could
happen
while
you
were.
Yes,
it's
. . .
it's
. . .
well,
I
can't
help
it,
Betty,
there's
something
COMFY
in
having
a
boy
to
go
about
with
--
like
other
girls
do.
One
they'd
eat
their
hats
to
get,
too!
I
can
see
it
in
their
eyes
when
we
pass;
Fred
with
his
great
long
legs
and
broad
shoulders
--
I
don't
nearly
come
up
to
them
--
and
his
blue
eyes
with
the
black
lashes,
and
his
shiny
black
hair.
And
I
like
his
tweeds,
the
Harris
smell
of
them,
and
his
dirty
old
pipe,
and
the
way
he
shows
his
teeth
--
he's
got
TOPPING
teeth
--
when
he
laughs
and
says
'ra-THER!'
And
other
people,
when
they
see
us,
look
. . .
well
I
don't
quite
know
how
to
say
it,
but
they
look
sort
of
pleased;
and
they
make
room
for
us
and
let
us
into
the
dark
corner-seats
at
the
pictures,
just
as
if
we'd
a
right
to
them.
And
they
never
laugh.
(Oh,
I
can't
STICK
being
laughed
at!
--
and
that's
the
truth.)
Yes,
it's
so
comfy,
Betty
darling
. . .
such
a
warm
cosy
comfy
feeling.
Oh,
WON'T
you
understand?"
"Gawd!
why
not
make
a
song
of
it?"
But
a
moment
later,
very
fiercely:
"And
who
is
it's
taught
you
to
think
all
this?
Who's
hinted
it
and
suggested
it
till
you've
come
to
believe
it?
. . .
believe
it's
what
you
really
feel."
"She
hasn't!
Mother's
never
said
a
word
. . .
about
Fred."
"Words?
--
why
waste
words?
. . .
when
she
can
do
it
with
a
cock
of
the
eye.
For
your
Fred,
that!"
and
the
girl
called
Betty
held
her
fingers
aloft
and
snapped
them
viciously.
"But
your
mother's
a
different
proposition."
"I
think
you're
simply
horrid."
To
this
there
was
no
reply.
"WHY
have
you
such
a
down
on
her?
What's
she
ever
done
to
you?
. . .
except
not
get
ratty
when
I
stay
out
late
with
Fred.
And
I
don't
see
how
you
can
expect
. . .
being
what
she
is
. . .
and
with
nobody
but
me
--
after
all
she
IS
my
mother
. . .
you
can't
alter
that.
I
know
very
well
--
and
you
know,
too
--
I'm
not
TOO
putrid-looking.
But"
--
beseechingly
--
"I'm
NEARLY
twenty-five
now,
Betty.
And
other
girls
. . .
well,
she
sees
them,
every
one
of
them,
with
a
boy
of
their
own,
even
though
they're
ugly,
or
fat,
or
have
legs
like
sausages
--
they've
only
got
to
ogle
them
a
bit
--
the
girls,
I
mean
. . .
and
there
they
are.
And
Fred's
a
good
sort
--
he
is,
really!
--
and
he
dances
well,
and
doesn't
drink,
and
so
. . .
so
why
SHOULDN'T
I
like
him?
. . .
and
off
my
own
bat
. . .
without
it
having
to
be
all
Mother's
fault,
and
me
nothing
but
a
parrot,
and
without
any
will
of
my
own?"
"Why?
Because
I
know
her
too
well,
my
child!
I
can
read
her
as
you'd
never
dare
to
. . .
even
if
you
could.
She's
sly,
your
mother
is,
so
sly
there's
no
coming
to
grips
with
her
. . .
one
might
as
well
try
to
fill
one's
hand
with
cobwebs.
But
she's
got
a
hold
on
you,
a
stranglehold,
that
nothing'll
loosen.
Oh!
mothers
aren't
fair
--
I
mean
it's
not
fair
of
nature
to
weigh
us
down
with
them
and
yet
expect
us
to
be
our
own
true
selves.
The
handicap's
too
great.
All
those
months,
when
the
same
blood's
running
through
two
sets
of
veins
--
there's
no
getting
away
from
that,
ever
after.
Take
yours.
As
I
say,
does
she
need
to
open
her
mouth?
Not
she!
She's
only
got
to
let
it
hang
at
the
corners,
and
you
reek,
you
drip
with
guilt."
Something
in
these
words
seemed
to
sting
the
younger
girl.
She
hit
back.
"I
know
what
it
is,
you're
jealous,
that's
what
you
are!
. . .
and
you've
no
other
way
of
letting
it
out.
But
I
tell
you
this.
If
ever
I
marry
--
yes,
MARRY!
--
it'll
be
to
please
myself,
and
nobody
else.
Can,
you
imagine
me
doing
it
to
oblige
her?"
Again
silence.
"If
I
only
think
what
it
would
be
like
to
be
fixed
up
and
settled,
and
able
to
live
in
peace,
without
this
eternal
dragging
two
ways
. . .
just
as
if
I
was
being
torn
in
half.
And
see
Mother
smiling
and
happy
again,
like
she
used
to
be.
Between
the
two
of
you
I'm
nothing
but
a
punch-ball.
Oh,
I'm
fed
up
with
it!
. . .
fed
up
to
the
neck.
As
for
you
. . .
And
yet
you
can
sit
there
as
if
you
were
made
of
stone!
Why
don't
you
SAY
something?
BETTY!
Why
won't
you
speak?"
But
no
words
came.
"I
can
FEEL
you
sneering.
And
when
you
sneer
I
hate
you
more
than
any
one
on
earth.
If
only
I'd
never
seen
you!"
"Marry
your
Fred,
and
you'll
never
need
to
again."
"I
will,
too!
I'll
marry
him,
and
have
a
proper
wedding
like
other
girls,
with
a
veil
and
bridesmaids
and
bushels
of
flowers.
And
I'll
live
in
a
house
of
my
own,
where
I
can
do
as
I
like,
and
be
left
in
peace,
and
there'll
be
no
one
to
badger
and
bully
me
--
Fred
wouldn't
. . .
ever!
Besides,
he'll
be
away
all
day.
And
when
he
came
back
at
night,
he'd
. . .
I'd
I
mean
I'd
----
"
But
here
the
flying
words
gave
out;
there
came
a
stormy
breath
and
a
cry
of:
"Oh,
Betty,
Betty!
. . .
I
couldn't,
no,
I
couldn't!
It's
when
I
think
of
THAT
. . .
Yes,
it's
quite
true!
I
like
him
all
right,
I
do
indeed,
but
only
as
long
as
he
doesn't
come
too
near.
If
he
even
sits
too
close,
I
have
to
screw
myself
up
to
bear
it"
--
and
flinging
herself
down
over
her
companion's
lap,
she
hid
her
face.
"And
if
he
tries
to
touch
me,
Betty,
or
even
takes
my
arm
or
puts
his
round
me.
. . .
And
then
his
face
. . .
when
it
looks
like
it
does
sometimes
all
wrong
. . .
as
if
it
had
gone
all
wrong
--
oh!
then
I
feel
I
shall
have
to
scream
--
out
loud.
I'm
afraid
of
him
. . .
when
he
looks
like
that.
Once
. . .
when
he
kissed
me
. . .
I
could
have
died
with
the
horror
of
it.
His
breath
. . .
his
breath
. . .
and
his
mouth
--
like
fruit
pulp
--
and
the
black
hairs
on
his
wrists
. . .
and
the
way
he
looked
--
and
. . .
and
everything!
No,
I
can't,
I
can't
. . .
nothing
will
make
me
. . .
I'd
rather
die
twice
over.
But
what
am
I
to
do?
Mother'll
NEVER
understand.
Oh,
why
has
it
got
to
be
like
this?
I
want
to
be
happy,
like
other
girls,
and
to
make
her
happy,
too
. . .
and
everything's
all
wrong.
You
tell
me,
Betty
darling,
you
help
me,
you're
older
. . .
you
KNOW
. . .
and
you
can
help
me,
if
you
will
. . .
if
you
only
will!"
And
locking
her
arms
round
her
friend
she
drove
her
face
deeper
into
the
warmth
and
darkness,
as
if,
from
the
very
fervour
of
her
clasp,
she
could
draw
the
aid
and
strength
she
needed.
Betty
had
sat
silent,
unyielding,
her
sole
movement
being
to
loosen
her
own
arms
from
her
sides
and
point
her
elbows
outwards,
to
hinder
them
touching
the
arms
that
lay
round
her.
But
at
this
last
appeal
she
melted;
and
gathering
the
young
girl
to
her
breast,
she
held
her
fast.
--
And
so
for
long
she
continued
to
sit,
her
chin
resting
lightly
on
the
fair
hair,
that
was
silky
and
downy
as
an
infant's,
and
gazing
with
sombre
eyes
over
the
stealthily
heaving
sea.
